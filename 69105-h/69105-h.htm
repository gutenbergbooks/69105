<p class="ph2">THE PATH <i>of</i> HONOR</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="small">THE TRAP OF SERGEANT DUBOSQ.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> was just breaking as I bade my fat little
host at the Beau Visage good-by and, leaving the
white streets of Tours behind me, crossed the
shallow river and turned my face southward on
the pleasant road to Poitiers.</p>

<p>The morning was a perfect one, soft and warm,
with the shimmer of sunshine and the stirring of
green things over the earth; for spring had come
again to our fair land of Touraine, and I sat erect
in the saddle, drinking long draughts of the good
air, riotously, gloriously happy. For I was young,
heart-whole, care-free, and setting forth upon a
pilgrimage which would have given my father joy
had he been alive to know. Yes, and it was the
last morning of my life that I could apply to
myself those three adjectives—though I did not
suspect it then.</p>

<p>The way was thronged with market-women
hastening toward the town, pushing their little
carts before them, their sabots clacking merrily
upon the hard, clean road, and their tongues clacking
more merrily still. They looked up, with
smiling countenances under their white caps, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
wish me good-morning and God-speed, and more
than once I caught a flash of dark eyes in a fresh
and rosy face which sent through me a pang of
regret that I could not linger.</p>

<p>The broad valley of the river seemed one continued
village, so closely were cottages and farmsteads
set; but as I pushed forward into the flat
country beyond, houses became less frequent, the
road grew more and more deserted, and the fields
stretched fallow and neglected to left and right
as far as the eye could reach. Here and
there, indeed, I caught a glimpse of a château
veiled by a screen of trees, but the land itself
seemed empty of humankind. There were no
flocks in the pastures, no peasants in the fields,
not a single plow driving a furrow through the
waiting soil.</p>

<p>All of which, I told myself, was the bitter fruit
of the Revolution. No one would sow when there
was small likelihood of reaping; besides, the
<i>canaille</i> found it more amusing to jostle about
the streets of Paris, to shout for the Nation, and
to watch the guillotine at work. Ever since that
dusty battalion from Marseilles, with its red bonnets
and furious faces, had marched up to Paris,
singing its terrifying hymn, others, large and small,
had followed, until it seemed that all France was
crowding to the capital. When hunger gnawed
there was always Citizen Santerre, offering refreshment
to every one under certain easy conditions;
there was work on the fortifications, or
enlistment in the National Guard; and finally of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
course, food might be stolen, if too difficult to
earn. Or as a last resort information against
one’s neighbor might be laid before the Committee
of Public Safety, and a reward secured.</p>

<p>I thanked God that we of Touraine had not
yet been caught in the eddies of that maelstrom.
Danton had been too busy at home to cast his
eyes in our direction, and if our peasants ran
away it was at least without leaving behind them
blackened walls and outraged bodies. So we had
lived our lives in peace, undisturbed by massacres,
by the worship of Reason, or by that grim machine
which toiled so ceaselessly upon the Place de la
Révolution.</p>

<p>But as I topped a rise in the road, I saw
that the instruments of war at least had at last
invaded even this peaceful country. Under a tree
by the roadside a group of soldiers were sitting,
and it needed no second glance to tell me they
were Republicans. They were lolling about, talking
idly among themselves; only their officer was
on his feet, but he was watching the road intently
and the instant his eyes met mine he uttered a
sharp command. In a breath his men had sprung
to arms and deployed across the road.</p>

<p>I was a peaceful traveller, intent on my own
business; so telling myself that I had nothing to
fear from even the most rabid of Revolutionists,
I continued on without hesitating. It could not
be for such a small and inoffensive fish as I that
a net so elaborate had been spread.</p>

<p>“Halt, citizen!” called the officer, as I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
up. “I must ask you to dismount,” he added,
looking at me with eyes of extraordinary brilliancy.</p>

<p>“Willingly,” I replied, “if one of your men
will hold my horse;” but two of them had him
by the bridle before the words were fully uttered.</p>

<p>“Now, citizen,” continued the officer, urbanely,
as I sprang from the saddle and faced him, “there
are a few questions which I shall have to ask you.
But the sun is warm, and to stand is fatiguing,
so let us sit down together in the shade of that
tree yonder.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I assented, and followed him to
a spot where we were defended not only from the
rays of sun but also from the curious ears of the
soldiers of the detachment, which still held its
position across the road.</p>

<p>My companion paused a moment to look at me
before he began his questioning, and gave me in
turn the opportunity to examine him. He was a
tall, raw-boned man, evidently of enormous
strength. His face was roughened by wind and
rain and burned to a deep red by the sun. A
ferocious mustache shaded mouth and chin, and
his eyes gleamed behind their bushy brows like
those of a beast in ambush. His hair was streaked
with gray, but I judged not so much from age,—for
his whole being was instinct with fire and
vigor,—as from the appalling scenes in which he
had played a part. He embodied for me at that
moment the very spirit of the Revolution, irate,
implacable, but with a certain rude sense of honor
and of justice and a confused belief that its cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was in some way bound up with human rights and
human progress.</p>

<p>“Come, citizen,” he began at last, “your
name?”</p>

<p>“Jean Tavernay,” I answered, deeming it wise
to omit the preposition.</p>

<p>“Your home?”</p>

<p>“Near Beaufort.”</p>

<p>“Your destination?”</p>

<p>“Poitiers.”</p>

<p>“Your business?”</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>“A private matter,” I said finally.</p>

<p>He frowned fiercely.</p>

<p>“The Republic has the right to know!” he said,
in a formidable voice.</p>

<p>“This is not a thing which in any way concerns
the Republic. It concerns only myself.”</p>

<p>“That is for me to judge. Besides, the business
of the Republic is that of each of its citizens.
Will you answer?”</p>

<p>I have,—I may as well confess at once what
the reader must soon discover,—concealed under
an exterior the most ordinary, a vein of obstinacy
which has often impelled me to deeds the most
foolish. It was so now. A hesitancy which had
its origin in boyish shyness crystallized suddenly
into sullen determination.</p>

<p>“Come,” repeated my questioner even more
fiercely, “will you answer?”</p>

<p>“No!” I said bluntly, and nerved myself for
what might follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Then I began to suspect that this dragon, like
that of Rouen, was ferocious only in appearance,
for he contented himself with gnawing at his
mustache and looking at me darkly.</p>

<p>“How am I to know you are not a <i>ci-devant</i>?”
he rasped out at last. “A traitor, a conspirator
against the Nation, a scoundrel upon whose head
a price has been set?”</p>

<p>“Merely by looking at me, my friend,” I retorted,
and smiled at the thought that I, whose
whole life had passed peacefully at Beaufort, could
be any of those things.</p>

<p>I cannot say that he actually smiled in answer,
but his face certainly relaxed.</p>

<p>“When did you leave Beaufort?” he questioned,
in a milder tone.</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“And last night?”</p>

<p>“I spent at Tours.”</p>

<p>“What inn?”</p>

<p>“The Beau Visage.”</p>

<p>“The landlord’s name?”</p>

<p>“Triboulet.”</p>

<p>“His appearance?”</p>

<p>“Short and fat, a red face, eyes like gimlets,
and a head as bald as an egg.”</p>

<p>My captor nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s Triboulet,” he said. “A fine fellow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed; “and his wife——”</p>

<p>My captor smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“She made you an omelet?”</p>

<p>“The best I ever ate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“She is famous for that,” he said, and looked
at me again, pulling pensively at his mustache.</p>

<p>“Come, citizen,” he added, and this time he
really smiled, “it is evident that you are not the
game I am after.”</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a wolf, not for a mouse.”</p>

<p>“At least I am not a wolf,” I conceded.</p>

<p>“Old Dubosq has seen too much of the world
to be mistaken in a matter so clear as this,” he
continued, throwing out his chest. “A conspirator?
Bah! You don’t know its meaning. You’re
too pink and white—too much of the nursery—its
odor clings to you! Why, infant, you’ve never
before been away from your mother!”</p>

<p>I flushed, and he burst into a roar of laughter
as he saw my face.</p>

<p>“A hit!” he cried. “Ah, citizen, would I
could blush like that! But for Dubosq that day
is past and far away. Come, my friend, all you
need is a little knowledge of the world to be a
perfect devil with the ladies. Join my troop and
let Dubosq finish you, polish you, give you the
true air. Come; it shall be my revenge.”</p>

<p>“Your revenge?”</p>

<p>“Against the women. They have made me
suffer and have laughed. A month ago I won my
promotion, but a petticoat intervened, and the
reward which should have been mine passed to
another. Some day I will tell you——”</p>

<p>A shout from his men interrupted him.</p>

<p>We sprang to our feet and saw, just topping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the rise in the road, another rider. He drew short
up at the shout and at sight of the guard barring
his passage. Then he wheeled sharp around as
though to retreat, but again stopped.</p>

<p>Dubosq chuckled.</p>

<p>“Caught!” he cried.</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t he go back?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because, my child, there’s another detachment
across the road down yonder, as you would have
seen had you looked around.” He drew a pistol
from his belt and fired it in the air. “That will
bring them on,” he added. “Now, citizen, you
will see the trap close—the trap of Sergeant
Dubosq. Advance, men! Bring him down if he
attempts to escape.”</p>

<p>The Blues began to advance slowly, their guns
presented.</p>

<p>“Hold your horse, citizen,” said Dubosq, “and
wait here for me. I have something more to say to
you;” and he set off after his men.</p>

<p>The fugitive looked about him again. He was
fairly caught between two fires. In a moment he
must surrender, covered by twenty muskets. But
he did not wait for that moment. Instead he put
his horse at the ditch, leaped it, and made off
across the fields.</p>

<p>“Fire!” yelled Dubosq. “Fire!”</p>

<p>A volley of shots rang out, echoed by another
from up the road, and my heart rejoiced as
I saw the fugitive keep on unharmed. But only
for an instant. His horse bounded twice, then
staggered and fell headlong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>The Blues gave a yell of triumph, leaped the
ditch and started after their quarry, spreading
fan-wise so that he could not escape. But he
sprang from the saddle even as his horse fell, and
ran with surprising speed toward a cluster of trees
just ahead. In a moment he had disappeared
among them.</p>

<p>I watched until his pursuers reached the grove
and plunged into it; then I tied my horse to the
tree and resumed my seat beneath its branches,
for I was curious to see the end of this encounter.
My sympathies were wholly with the fugitive.
Whatever his offense, so gallant a dash for liberty
deserved to be successful. And yet he could
scarcely hope to escape with twenty men at his
heels.</p>

<p>Once a chorus of frantic yells came to me from
the grove, and I thought for a time that the chase
was ended. But the moments passed, and I saw no
sign of either the fugitive or his pursuers. Perhaps
he had eluded them after all; or perhaps they
were pushing across the country after him. In
either event it was useless for me to tarry longer;
it was time for me to be getting forward if I
wished to reach Châtellerault, as I had planned,
by nightfall. Only I should have liked to say
good-by to Sergeant Dubosq. There was about
the man a fascination, an air of deviltry, that
pleased me. Perhaps at another time I might even
have found myself listening to his words, but
now——</p>

<p>“Sit still, monsieur,” said a low voice just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
behind me; and I started round to find myself
looking down the long barrel of a pistol above
which gleamed two eyes, blue and cold as steel.
“I was moved to shoot you,” he went on evenly,
“as the shortest way out; but after all I am not a
murderer. I will give you one chance. I must
have your horse. Give me your word of honor
to sit there quietly, and you are safe; refuse,”—and
he made a menacing little motion with his
pistol.</p>

<p>There could be no doubting his earnestness.
One glance at that resolute countenance convinced
me that its owner would not hesitate to carry out
his threat. But to lose my horse——</p>

<p>“Come,” he said; “decide quickly. Faith, the
choice ought not to be difficult;” and he laughed
grimly.</p>

<p>“Take the horse, monsieur,” I said, in a voice
trembling with rage and chagrin. “But my hour
will come!”</p>

<p>He laughed again, put up his pistol, and came
out upon the road.</p>

<p>As I watched him untie my horse, I realized
suddenly all that this loss would mean to me, and a
blind impulse seized me to rush upon him and
run him through. I think I must have yielded to
it, in spite of my passed word, had he not seemed
to trust it so implicitly. For he even turned his
back to me as he bent to adjust the stirrups.</p>

<p>He seemed in no haste—indeed, I was apparently
far more excited than he—and I had time to
admire the erect figure, the easy carriage, the grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of movement. Dubosq had spoken truly when he
had pointed out that no one could mistake me for
this finished cavalier. He sprang to the saddle
with superb unconcern and paused for a look about
him. He was even humming a song.</p>

<p>“Ah, there they come,” he said, and following
his eye, I saw Dubosq and his men burst from the
grove and come charging across the field. “At
last they have discovered how I eluded them!
Blockheads! Adieu, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Till we meet again,” I corrected.</p>

<p>He laughed blithely.</p>

<p>“As you will,” he said, and gathered up the
reins. “Whither are you bound?” he added, turning
back to me.</p>

<p>“To Poitiers,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then we may indeed meet again;” and waving
his hand to his enemies, who by this time were
very near, he set spur to flank and galloped away
down the road.</p>

<p>A shower of bullets followed him, but he kept
on apparently unhurt, and in a moment more was
out of gunshot.</p>

<p>Dubosq came panting up, his men at his heels.
He was fairly livid. He stopped for an instant
to shake his fist at the cloud of dust far down the
road. Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” he cried, hoarsely. “Aristocrat!”
And I saw how the great veins stood out across
his forehead. “So you had the effrontery to wait
for me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Assuredly,” I replied, as calmly as I could,
“since you requested it.”</p>

<p>He glared at me for a moment with bloodshot
eyes. Then he turned to his men.</p>

<p>“Secure him!” he said. “We will let him
espouse Madame Guillotine.”</p>

<p>And before I could open my lips to protest, my
hands were lashed behind me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="small">IN AN ENEMY I FIND A FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant I was too astonished to resist;
then the indignity of it—the indignity of the
strong and cruel hands which seized and held me—swept
over me like flame, and I shook off my assailants
and faced Dubosq.</p>

<p>“Loose me!” I cried, struggling furiously
with my bonds. “Loose me! I demand that you
loose me!”</p>

<p>Dubosq laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>“At your service,” he sneered. “Any other
orders?”</p>

<p>I realized how impotent I was, and the knowledge
struck chill to my heart. Dubosq could stand
me up at the side of the road and order me shot,
and no one would question or protest. He had
only to give the word. I felt as the wild beast
feels caught in a sudden trap.</p>

<p>“But this is an outrage!” I protested thickly,
striving to still the trembling of my lips; for I was
young—remember always, my reader, that I was
young and new to the world.</p>

<p>Dubosq stood regarding me, gnawing his mustache
savagely. I dare say the trembling lip did
not escape him.</p>

<p>“Outrage or not,” he growled, “you are under
arrest, citizen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“And for what?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“As an accomplice of the <i>ci-devant</i> Favras.”</p>

<p>My astonishment was so overwhelming that even
he discerned it.</p>

<p>“Of course you are innocent,” he sneered.</p>

<p>“Citizen Dubosq,” I said slowly, “I give you
my word of honor that I have never before even
heard of the person you mention. As for being
his accomplice, that is too absurd to discuss.”</p>

<p>“It is strange, then,” commented Dubosq,
grimly, “that you should have been so complaisant
as to permit him to ride away upon your
horse. But no doubt you have an explanation.
There is always an explanation.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I cried, understanding suddenly and
looking down the empty road. “So that was the
<i>ci-devant</i> Favras! I am glad to know his name,
for I have an account to settle with him. So far
from permitting him to take the horse, I had an
impulse to murder him.”</p>

<p>“And why did you not?” Dubosq demanded.
“That would at least have saved your own neck.”</p>

<p>“I had given him my word,” I explained, and
related the dilemma in which I had found myself.
“But even then,” I concluded, “I would have
killed him had he not turned his back.”</p>

<p>Dubosq listened, looking at me keenly. At the
last words he nodded, almost imperceptibly, as
though he understood. Then he glanced moodily
away across the field.</p>

<p>I followed his eyes and saw approaching us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
from the grove two men bearing the body of a
third.</p>

<p>“Is that his work?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dubosq; and fell silent until the
bearers reached the road and placed the body on
the grass beneath the tree. I saw with a shudder
that the man had been stabbed in the back.</p>

<p>“Yes,” repeated Dubosq fiercely, “that is his
work. He crept upon him from behind and struck
him down. He did not hesitate because his victim’s
back was turned. Oh, these traitors, these
aristocrats, with their talk of honor!” and he
shook his clenched fists above his head.</p>

<p>“But how did he escape?” I queried, for even
yet I did not understand.</p>

<p>“How did he escape?” yelled Dubosq, his face
purple. “He escaped because his wits are better
than ours. There is that to be said for the aristocrats—their
wits are better than ours, clods that
we are! He murdered this man——”</p>

<p>“Not murder, citizen,” I interrupted. “Not
that—self-defense.”</p>

<p>“Self-defense!” roared Dubosq. “In the back?
Murder, I say! Then shielding himself in that
ditch yonder, he worked his way back to the road,
mounted your horse and was off, while we were
blundering around in that little grove. I should
have thought of the ditch;” and he stood glowering
at it. “I did—too late! I disgust myself!”</p>

<p>“And I suffer in consequence,” I added.
“Come, my friend, confess that you believe my
story. Look at me. I am no conspirator—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
your heart you know it. If I had been the friend
of that fellow, I would have ridden away behind
him; certainly I should not have remained here
waiting for your return. To revenge yourself on
me because your trap has failed—that is unworthy
of you. Besides I have suffered enough already—and
for no fault.”</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment, and his face
softened. I saw that the storm was over.</p>

<p>“I believe you, citizen,” he said; “you are free,”
and he whipped out his knife and cut my bonds.</p>

<p>For thanks I held out my hand and he gripped it
warmly.</p>

<p>“Come,” he urged, “join my troop, pin on the
tri-color, and I will make a man of you.”</p>

<p>But I shook my head.</p>

<p>“No, my friend,” I said, “an errand of honor
calls me to Poitiers.”</p>

<p>He looked at me with renewed suspicion.</p>

<p>“Which reminds me,” he added, “that you have
not yet told me the nature of that errand.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” I said, “as a friend;” and I
whispered a swift sentence in his ear.</p>

<p>He burst out laughing, his good humor restored
in an instant.</p>

<p>“Well, go your way,” he said, slapping me on
the shoulder, “and good luck go with you. At
the fête, citizen, drink a health to old Dubosq. As
for me, I have the pleasant duty of burying my
dead, and reporting to my superiors that I am a
fool and that the trap is empty;” and he glowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
angrily down the road, his mustache drooping
dismally.</p>

<p>“Your turn will come,” I urged. “Or if not
yours, mine—of that I am certain.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, with a growl, “I will yet
get my hands on him, and when I do, he will have
reason to remember it. Adieu, citizen,” he added.
“My compliments to the lady. Come, my children,
march!” And he and his soldiers set off toward
Tours, bearing their dead with them.</p>

<p>I watched them for a few moments with something
like regret. After all, Dubosq had spoken
truly. I had seen little of the world, and he had
offered me a chance to see more in gallant company.
I could not but admit that he would have
made an admirable guide and companion. If his
cockade were only white! But even then I could
not have followed him. For I was not free—another
duty lay before me. Would I ever be
free, I wondered—free to march away whither I
listed, to live a man’s life and grow to man’s
stature? Or would I always be tied to some
woman’s petticoat, imprisoned in a trivial round
of daily duties, as were so many men? Was I on
this journey simply exchanging one petticoat for
another?</p>

<p>With such thoughts for companions,—surely less
pleasant than Dubosq!—I turned my face again to
the south, and strode along with such speed as my
legs could compass. I am not fond of foot-exercise,
and it was not at all in this ridiculous fashion
that I had thought to make the journey to Poitiers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Besides there was need that my entry into that city
should be made with a certain dignity, and I knew
well that the whole contents of my purse would
not purchase a new horse, to say nothing of a
new equipment.</p>

<p>For the horse was not all that I had lost. In
the holsters of the saddle was a pair of handsome
pistols which had belonged to my father, and in
the portmanteau strapped behind it an array of
gallant clothing such as I had never possessed
before, and would in all likelihood never again
possess. As to replenishing my purse, I remembered
only too acutely how my mother had pinched
herself for months to provide me with this outfit.
No, decidedly, to repair this misfortune I had only
my own prowess to depend upon, and I am free to
say that it was not of a quality greatly to enhearten
me. Certainly my first adventure in the
world had ended most disastrously.</p>

<p>So I trudged on, looking neither to the right nor
to the left, turning my misfortune over in my
mind, and recalling the good points of my horse,—a
friend and companion almost since my boyhood,—the
comfort of my saddle, and the beauties
of my wardrobe, as a starving man will picture
to himself the savory details of some banquet he
has enjoyed in happier days. And I almost found
it in my heart to regret that I had not struck the
robber down in that moment when he had dared to
turn his back upon me.</p>

<p>There were few people on the road, but such as
I met stared at me curiously, evidently unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
understand how it was that a young fellow so
gallantly arrayed should be footing it through the
dust with sour countenance. This of course served
only to increase my spleen, and ended in my pulling
my hat over my eyes and trudging on without
glancing up, even at the rustle of a petticoat. I
know not how great a distance I covered in this
fashion, but at last the sun, rising high in the
heavens, beat down upon me with such ardor that
my head began to swim dizzily. I looked about
for shelter, and seeing just ahead of me a little
cluster of mean houses, hastened my steps in the
hope that there might be an inn among them.</p>

<p>So indeed there proved to be. But when I
came to the threshold of the low, ill-smelling room,
dark almost as a dungeon even in full day, I hesitated,
for I was armed only with sword and dagger
and it was impossible to see what lay within.
Decidedly I had no wish to risk my purse, and
perhaps my life as well, for the sake of a bottle
of bad wine.</p>

<p>But a gay voice encouraged me.</p>

<p>“Enter, monsieur,” it called. “I was awaiting
you.”</p>

<p>And as my eyes grew somewhat accustomed to
the darkness, I descried, seated at a table in one
corner, my enemy, my despoiler, smiling at me as
though he were my dearest friend.</p>

<p>“Come,” he added, “join me;” and such was
the wizardry of his voice and the gesture which
accompanied it, that whatever my reluctance, I
could not but obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“What is your name, monsieur?” he asked, as
I took the seat opposite his; and he smiled again as
he caught my glance.</p>

<p>“Jean de Tavernay,” I answered; “and, monsieur,
I have to say to you——”</p>

<p>“One moment,” he broke in, holding up his
hand. “My name perhaps you have already
heard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you are who the Republicans said you
were.”</p>

<p>“And that was?”</p>

<p>“One M. de Favras.”</p>

<p>“They are not at your heels?”</p>

<p>“No, they returned to Tours.”</p>

<p>“Disappointed?”</p>

<p>“Extremely so.”</p>

<p>He laughed, then grew suddenly sober and
knitted his brows in thought, which I somehow
dared not interrupt. After all, there was no cause
for haste. He could not escape me.</p>

<p>“It looked like a trap,” he said, at last.</p>

<p>“It was a trap,” I assured him.</p>

<p>“And set for me?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>He pondered this a moment longer, then put it
from him.</p>

<p>“No matter,” he said. “Why waste thought on
a trap from which one has escaped? And now,
M. de Tavernay, to your affair. I see the words
which are trembling on your lips; I read the
thought which is passing in your mind. You
would say that I have not used you as one gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
uses another. I admit it. You are thinking
that now you will revenge yourself. I do not
blame you. I owe you an apology for treating
you in the fashion that I did. But it was with
me a question of life or death. I had no alternative.
And I assure you,” he added, smiling grimly,
“I should not have hesitated to kill you had you
chosen to resist. I gave you a chance for your
life merely because I saw that you were not a
Republican, but a traveller like myself. Had you
worn the tri-color, nothing would have saved you.”</p>

<p>“All of which I saw in your eyes, monsieur,” I
said. “It was for that reason I did not resist.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he asked, looking at me, “which is it,
monsieur—an apology and this bottle of wine, or
our swords back of the cabaret? For myself, I
hope it is the former. But it is for you to choose.”</p>

<p>There was a kindness in his tone not to be resisted,
an authority in his glance and in the expression
of his face which bore in upon me anew my
own youth and inexperience.</p>

<p>“The wine, monsieur,” I said. “The other
would be folly.”</p>

<p>He nodded and filled our glasses, then raised his
to his lips.</p>

<p>“To our better acquaintance,” he said, and we
drank the toast. I was beginning to wonder how
I had ever been so blind as to think this man an
enemy.</p>

<p>“There was one moment,” I confessed, “when
you were in some danger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“I saw it,” he said quietly. “It was for that
reason I turned my back to you.”</p>

<p>I stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“To help you overcome temptation,” he explained.
“One gentleman does not break his
word by stabbing another in the back.”</p>

<p>A warm flush of pleasure sprang to my cheeks.
Then a sudden vision rose before me of a limp
body in Republican uniform——</p>

<p>“But you——” I stopped, confused, conscious
that I was uttering my thought aloud, and that the
thought was not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he went on, smiling sadly, “you would
say that I stabbed that poor fellow in the back.
Believe me, monsieur, I should have preferred a
thousand times to meet him face to face. But I
had no choice. A moment’s delay, and I should
have been taken. So I hardened my heart and
struck.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, monsieur,” I murmured.</p>

<p>He nodded, the shadow still on his face.</p>

<p>“Fortune of war,” he said, with affected lightness.
“We must make the best of it. And now,
M. de Tavernay,” he added, rising, “you will find
your horse awaiting you outside yonder door, as
fresh as when you started with him from Tours.
I have secured another in a less peremptory way
than I found necessary to adopt with you. It is
foolhardy for me to linger here. I must push on
at once. But you may be weary, you may wish to
avoid the heat of the day; you may, in a word,
prefer to continue your journey alone and at your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
leisure. If so, farewell; but if you are ready to
go on, I assure you that I shall be very glad of
your company.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, monsieur,” I said, my decision
taken on the instant. “I am quite ready to go.”</p>

<p>“Good! come then,” and throwing a gold-piece
on the table he started toward the door.</p>

<p>Not until that instant did I remember that the
inn must have a keeper, and that the keeper would
have ears, which he had no doubt kept wide open
during all this talk. I looked around for him, and
as though guessing my thought, he shambled
slowly forward from a dark corner—as ill-favored
a villain as I ever saw.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else monsieur wishes?” he
asked, looking at me with a glance so venomous
that I recoiled as though a snake had struck at me.</p>

<p>“No,” I stammered, “except to tell you that
there is your money.”</p>

<p>He picked up the coin without a word and spun
it in his hand, while I hastened after my companion,
anxious to escape from that sinister place
into the clear day. I found him awaiting me just
outside the door.</p>

<p>“Our horses will be here in a moment,” he said.
“I have sent for them.”</p>

<p>“I shall breathe more freely when I am in the
saddle and well away from here,” I answered.
“There is a fellow back yonder who is longing
to assassinate both of us.”</p>

<p>“Our host?” and he laughed lightly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
noticed him. He is like all the others—they would
all jump to assassinate us, if they dared.”</p>

<p>“This one looked particularly wolfish.”</p>

<p>“They are all wolfish, and like the wolf arrant
cowards, save when they hunt in pack.”</p>

<p>“But if he overheard?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we were a little indiscreet,” he agreed,
sober for an instant. “But one peril more or less—what
does it matter?” he added, with a shrug.
“Here are the horses. Permit me to return you
yours, with apologies and thanks.”</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to get him back,” I said, patting
his nose.</p>

<p>“The pleasure seems to be mutual,” observed
my companion; and indeed there was no mistaking
the joy in the eyes of my old friend. “You would
better look over your belongings,” he added.
“There are thieves about.”</p>

<p>But I found that nothing had been disturbed.
My pistols were in their holsters, and my portmanteau
was still strapped behind the saddle.</p>

<p>“Then let us be off,” said M. de Favras.</p>

<p>Not until we were well out of the village and
cantering briskly toward the south with a clear
road behind us, did I feel at ease. Then I took
my chin from my shoulder and directed an admiring
gaze at my companion—would I ever acquire
such an air? He caught my glance and smiled.</p>

<p>“Where had you intended spending the night,
M. de Tavernay?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“At Châtellerault,” I said.</p>

<p>“But you cannot hope to reach Châtellerault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
to-day,” he protested, “after the delay which I
have caused you. You must be my guest to-night.
My château is just beyond Dange. I will see you
on your way at daybreak to-morrow, and you can
reach Poitiers with ease by sunset. I hope you will
accept, my friend,” he went on, seeing that I hesitated,
“if only that I may feel you have wholly
forgiven me. Besides,” he added, with an air of
finality, “it is folly to travel unattended in this
country after nightfall. It is overrun with brigands
who shout for liberty, equality, fraternity, only
to conceal their crimes.”</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I needed no urging. I tried to
stammer something of the pleasure the invitation
gave me, but he stopped me with a kind little wave
of the hand.</p>

<p>“For the past month I have been in the Bocage,”
he went on, when that was settled. “Ah, if you
would see true heroism, my friend, you must go
there. A devoted people, fighting for their homes
and for their faith, under leaders the most heroic
that army ever had. It is against those peasants
of La Vendée that this cursed carnival of slaughter
will wreck itself.”</p>

<p>His face was alight with enthusiasm, his eyes
shining with deep emotion.</p>

<p>“They are carrying all before them,” he went
on, more calmly. “To-day, they are mere scattered
peasants, working in their fields. To-morrow,
they are an army of fifty thousand, springing from
the very ground to smite the enemy. They shoot
him down from behind their hedges, they put him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to the sword, they send him staggering back to his
barracks, all but annihilated. Then the next day,
if there is no more fighting, they are back again
with their flocks and herds. It recalls that golden
age of Greece when every man was eager to give
his life for his country.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” I objected, “trained troops should
be able easily to stand against them.”</p>

<p>“They have not yet done so,” he retorted.
“We have taken Les Herbiers, Montaigu, Chantonnay,
Cholet and Vihiers, one after the other,
like shaking ripe plums from a tree. After all,
victory depends not so much upon organization or
generalship, or even numbers, as upon the spirit of
the men themselves. The army which goes into a
battle with each individual unit of it bent on
victory wins the victory. The army which fights
half-heartedly loses. That is the history of every
battle. The people of the Bocage are fighting for
their homes and their religion—their souls are in
the conflict, and they will never admit themselves
defeated until the last man has been slain. Within
a month the Blues will have been driven completely
from Vendée, and the King will reign there;” and
at the words he crossed himself. “‘God and the
King’ is our watchword.”</p>

<p>He saw the question in the glance I turned upon
him.</p>

<p>“You are wondering,” he said, “why at such a
time I should have left the army. Two nights
since I received a message that my wife was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
dangerously ill—dying even. The army will be
victorious without me—but my wife——”</p>

<p>He stopped. I understood and nodded gently.</p>

<p>“Only that could have brought me away,” he
added—“the certainty that she needed me. I
started at once but found the Blues in force at
Coulonges. I attempted to turn aside and at once
lost my way amid the innumerable and abominable
roads with which that country is cursed. I was
forced finally to ride on to Chinon and then along
the Loire, for it seemed as though every road was
blocked by the enemy. I should have reached the
château last night, and behold me only this far;”
and he pricked his horse savagely and galloped
forward.</p>

<p>I followed, and for a time we held the pace
without exchanging a word, he busy with his own
thoughts, and I wrapped in contemplation of the
marvellous turn of fortune which had not only
restored me all that I had lost, but which had also
given me the friendship of a man like this. I
looked at him from time to time, admiring more
than ever the fine face and graceful figure. He
was, I judged, not over thirty; but there was
something in the glance of his eye, in the set of
his lips, which told me that he had played his
part in the world for many years. Perhaps the
time was at hand when I should play my part, too.</p>

<p>At last we drew rein to give our horses breath,
and my companion pointed out to me some of the
features of the country. To our right was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
gentle valley of the Vienne, and finally we dipped
into it and crossed the river at a ford.</p>

<p>“Now I am at home,” he said, looking about
with a smile of pleasure. “But in this case home
is not without its dangers, for I may be recognized
at any turn, and the adventure of this morning
warns me to be careful. At the village, there may
even be another detachment of Republicans. So
I think it would be wise to turn aside and take
that path yonder, by which we shall not only avoid
the town but come directly to my estate.”</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur,” I agreed; and in another
moment we had plunged among the trees.</p>

<p>The soft earth of the wood, with its carpet of
leaves, deadened the sound of our horses’ hoofs
and we went on silently among the shadows for
some time. Then we turned abruptly to the left,
the wood opened, and again I saw the river gleaming
before us.</p>

<p>“There is the château,” he said suddenly, and
following his gesture I saw a lofty tower rising
above the trees. “That tower,” he added, smiling,
“is my heritage from an amorous ancestor, who
built it some hundreds of years ago to shelter a
fair lady, whom a rival coveted. The tower was
designed to withstand attack—and did withstand
it—so the lady remained in our family and helped
perpetuate it. That brave Marquis de Favras,
who died so gallantly on the Place de Grève two
years ago, belonged to that branch; so you see we
have no reason to be ashamed of it, however
irregular its origin. There is the modern wing,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
he added, as we came out suddenly upon the road,
“built by my father.”</p>

<p>It was a handsome building of white stone,
and as we approached it I saw two ladies strolling
upon the terrace which ran across its front. At the
gate, a man, swart and heavy-set, stood for a
moment eyeing us.</p>

<p>“Ah, Pasdeloup!” cried my companion; and
at the word the man sprang to the gate and threw
it back with a clang, his face beaming. “Alert
as ever!” added his master, waved his hand to
him and galloped past, while the other gazed
after him with something very like adoration transfiguring
his rough countenance.</p>

<p>At the sound of our horses’ hoofs upon the
gravelled road, the ladies turned and looked toward
us. Then one of them flew down the steps, her
hands outstretched, her face alight.</p>

<p>“Madame!” cried my companion. “Madame!”
and he threw himself from his horse and
caught her to his heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="small">I FALL INTO A PLEASANT BONDAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Then</span> you are not ill?” my friend was saying,
as I dismounted and drew near. “You are not
dying? Thank God for that!”</p>

<p>“Ill?” echoed the lady. “Dying? Nonsense!
Look at me!”</p>

<p>“You are adorable!” he cried, and kissed the
hands he held in his.</p>

<p>“Sad I have been,” she went on, blushing but
still gazing fondly up at him. “That was because
you were away from me, in danger yonder. Yet
I tried to be brave, for I knew that you were
serving your country and that you would not forget
me.”</p>

<p>“Forget you!” he repeated; and my own heart
warmed in sympathy as he gazed down at her, his
eyes alight. Ah, here was no match prearranged
no marriage of convenience, but a true mating.
So true that there could be about it no false pride,
no dissimulation or pretense of indifference; so
true that it was still the lover talking to his
mistress, as well as the husband talking to his
wife.</p>

<p>I know it is the custom in certain circles in the
great cities to sneer at all this—to seek love anywhere
but in the family circle; but we of the provinces
are not like that. Do not think it. We live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
closer to the heart of things—closer to nature,
closer to each other, closer to the good God—and
I think we are sounder at core.</p>

<p>“But I had a message saying you were ill,” he
continued. “You did not send it, then?”</p>

<p>“No; but I bless the sender since it has brought
you back to me.”</p>

<p>“And not alone,” he added, remembering my
presence. “Permit me to present to you, madame,
M. de Tavernay. I began by stealing his horse
and ended by gaining his friendship. Be kind to
him. Monsieur, this is my wife, Madame la
Comtesse de Favras.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand to me with a charming
smile, but her eyes and thoughts were only for her
husband, nor could I find it in my heart to blame
her, for, beside him, I was so crude, so ordinary,
worth scarcely a passing glance. Indeed, I was
myself somewhat confused at the revelation of my
friend’s distinguished title and bowed over her
hand awkwardly enough.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, monsieur,” she said. “At
dinner we must hear the story of these adventures.
You have no doubt been all day in the saddle—you
need rest, refreshment. Come—but first you
must meet my guest;” and she led the way toward
the terrace where her companion awaited us.</p>

<p>“What fortune!” cried M. le Comte, as he
sprang up the steps, and in another moment he
was kissing the cheek of a lady, young, divinely
fair, as I saw in the single glance I dared take at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
her, who blushed most becomingly as she received
his salute.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he added, “this is M. de Tavernay.
I have already asked Madame la Comtesse to be
kind to him. With you, I can only beg that you
will not be cruel. M. de Tavernay, this is Mlle. de
Chambray, who permits you to kiss her hand.”</p>

<p>As I bowed before her and touched her fingers
with lips not wholly steady, I was suddenly conscious
of the dust and travel-stains which covered
me, head to foot. She would think me ridiculous,
no doubt; but when I summoned courage to glance
up at her, I was astonished to see that her face was
scarlet, and that she was staring at me with
startled eyes. Then she withdrew her hand and
turned hastily away, her shoulders shaking convulsively,
and I felt my own cheeks grow red.</p>

<p>Luckily our friends were too engrossed in each
other to perceive this bit of comedy—or perhaps
tragedy would, from my standpoint, be the better
word. A moment later, my ears still burning, I
stalked stiffly away after the man to whom I had
been entrusted, through a vestibule, up a wide
flight of stairs, and into a spacious room overlooking
the gardens at the back of the house.</p>

<p>“Dinner is at eight,” said the man. “If there
is anything monsieur requires he will ring the
bell yonder;” and after unstrapping my portmanteau
and glancing around to assure himself
that everything was right, he left the room and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>The instant I was alone, dignity and self-control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
fell from me like a mantle, and flinging myself
into a chair, I stared blindly out through the open
window. The garden was a formal one in the
Italian style, not large, but elegantly planned, and
sloping gently to the margin of the river, which
seemed here both broad and deep. Beyond it was
a tangle of trees and shrubbery, and farther away,
upon the side of a little hill, were the white houses
of a village, their windows bright with the rays
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>But it was at none of these things I looked—though
I see them now as plainly as if they were
here before me—for my eyes were turned inward
at the tumult in my own bosom, and my brain was
wondering numbly why it was that my life, heretofore
so bright, had turned suddenly so gray; that
the green valleys of the future had changed to
sandy, barren wastes; that the very savor of living
was as dust in my throat. I had glanced for an
instant into a pair of startled eyes, and that
instant had struck the boyish carelessness from
my heart as with a blow.</p>

<p>But at last I shook the feeling off—or perhaps
it was only the warm blood of youth asserting
itself—and when the man came with the candles
I could proceed with my toilet with almost, if not
quite, my old calmness. When it was finished I
turned to the glass and contemplated the reflection
there. Fresh the face undoubtedly was, and if
not handsome, at least not grotesque; but with the
memory of my host before me I thought it absurdly
boyish. The figure, while erect enough, had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that easy poise I had marked in him, nor did the
garments in which I had arrayed myself fall into
those natural and graceful lines which somehow
stamp the finished gentleman. As I stared
gloomily at myself I recalled the careless words of
Sergeant Dubosq. Yes, he was right; he had hit
the mark—I was too young, too pink and white,
too much of the country.</p>

<p>Comforting myself as well as I could with the
thought that time would remedy these defects, I
turned away, opened the door and went down the
stair. Beyond the vestibule was the saloon, a
circular marble room, extremely elegant and well-furnished,
and still beyond this the drawing-room,
with four large paintings of the French victories
of 1744 upon the walls. There was no one in
either room, and I was examining the paintings,
which no doubt pictured events in which the father
of my host had taken part, and which appeared to
me of splendid execution, when I heard the rustling
of skirts behind me. I turned to perceive Mlle.
de Chambray upon the threshold, and the fear of
her ridicule was swept away in the burst of happiness
at seeing her again.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it you, M. de Tavernay?” she said,
hesitating and coloring divinely.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I, mademoiselle,” I answered, trembling
at this first time that she had ever addressed
me.</p>

<p>“And alone?” she added, with a quick glance
about the room. “It is strange that madame is
not down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“She and M. le Comte doubtless have much to
say to each other,” I hastened to explain, for I
too thought it strange—though the rack itself
could not have wrung the admission from me.</p>

<p>“Yes—no doubt,” she agreed, but she was
plainly not convinced, and still hesitated on the
threshold.</p>

<p>“It would be cruel to interrupt them,” I added.
“Besides, I assure you that I am quite harmless.”</p>

<p>This time she permitted her glance to dwell
upon me for an instant, and I caught the perfect
contour of her face.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” she retorted, “unless
your appearance is most deceptive. I think I
would better join madame;” and she made a
motion toward the door.</p>

<p>“If there is any oath I can swear, mademoiselle,”
I protested, “prescribe it—I will take it
gladly. I will agree to sit here in this corner, if
you wish it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will?” she said; and looked at me
doubtfully, but with a glimmer of mischief in her
eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle; I am capable even of that
heroism.”</p>

<p>“I hear that you surrendered rather easily this
morning,” she taunted.</p>

<p>“There was a pistol at my ear,” I explained,
“and the face of M. le Comte behind it. I saw no
reason to throw away my life for nothing more
important than a horse. I am doubly glad now that
I was so sensible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>She looked at me, her brows uplifted.</p>

<p>“Life means more to me now than it did this
morning,” I hastened to explain. “Oh, vastly
more! So I rejoice that I am not lying back there
on the road with a bullet through me. Even had
M. le Comte missed me, I should not be here.”</p>

<p>“He would not have missed. A pistol in the
hands of M. le Comte is a dangerous thing.”</p>

<p>“I have never encountered but one thing more
dangerous, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“A pair of brown eyes, levelled at me by a
person who knows their power,” I answered, and
trembled at my temerity.</p>

<p>But instead of being offended she burst into a
peal of laughter and advanced into the room.</p>

<p>“Really, M. de Tavernay,” she said, her eyes
dancing, “I fear that you are not so harmless as
you pretend.”</p>

<p>“But nevertheless you will remain, mademoiselle;
you owe me that reparation.”</p>

<p>“Reparation?” she repeated, with raised brows.</p>

<p>“For laughing at me. True you turned away
your face, but you could not conceal the quivering
of your shoulders.”</p>

<p>She colored deeply and this time retreated in
earnest toward the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, do not go,” I pleaded. “I pardon you—it
was nothing. Laugh at me again if you wish,
only do not go.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, stopped, came back.</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> beg your pardon, monsieur,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
“Believe me, it was not in the least at you I was
laughing, but at a sudden thought—at the strange
chance——”</p>

<p>She stopped, evidently confused.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I hastened to assure her. “I
forgive and forget. Or rather, I shall not forget,
because you laugh adorably.”</p>

<p>“In truth,” she said, with just a touch of malice,
“one would imagine you were straight from
Versailles instead of——”</p>

<p>“Beaufort,” I said, flushing a little.</p>

<p>“And how does it happen you are so far from
home?” she queried, bending upon me a look of
raillery.</p>

<p>Then I remembered; my heart turned to lead in
my bosom, and despite myself a groan burst from
me in the first sharp agony of recollection.</p>

<p>“What is it, monsieur?” she questioned, instantly
serious, and coming toward me quickly.
“You are not ill?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said hoarsely, dropping upon a seat.
“I am very ill, mademoiselle—so ill that I fear
I shall never make a recovery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, horrible!” she cried; and sat down beside
me, and passed her handkerchief across my forehead—her
handkerchief, fragrant with I know not
what intoxicating scent. “But a moment ago you
were quite well, or seemed so. Is it the heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle,” I answered, rallying
sufficiently to perceive that the situation was not
without its advantages, and determining to maintain
it as long as possible. “It is the heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“And you are subject to such seizures?” she
continued, still gazing at me anxiously, so near
that I could see the dew upon her lips, could catch
the child-like fragrance of her breath. Here was
a woman different from any that I had ever known
or dreamed of—genuine, unaffected, of a sincerity
almost boyish.</p>

<p>“This is the first, mademoiselle,” I said, gripping
my hands tight in the effort to maintain my
self-control, to resist the temptation to seize her
and crush her to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, how you suffer!” she cried, seeing the
gesture and misinterpreting it. Yet now that I
have written the word, I am wondering if she did
misinterpret it. Looking back upon the scene, I
am inclined to think that she saw much more
than I suspected, and that I was really merely a
mouse she played with. Mouse—that was Sergeant
Dubosq’s word. But certainly no eyes could
have been more guileless than those she turned
upon me. “Here,” she added, “perhaps this will
help you;” and she held a little inlaid bottle
beneath my nostrils.</p>

<p>I was not expecting it and just at that instant
drew a full breath, with the consequence that for
some moments after I could draw no other. Tears
poured from my eyes and I must have been altogether
an absurd object; but strange to say my
companion did not laugh—or if she did I was
too disordered to perceive it.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” cried a voice from the door.
“What are you doing to M. de Tavernay,
Charlotte?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Charlotte!” echoed my heart. “Charlotte!
Charlotte!” Then I caught my breath again for
fear that I had cried the name aloud.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay has just had a very severe
seizure of the heart, madame,” answered my companion.
“I was letting him smell of my salts and
he took a full breath.”</p>

<p>“I am better,” I said, struggling to my feet
and bowing to madame. “A thousand thanks,
mademoiselle. But for your thoughtfulness I
might not have rallied. I needed heroic treatment.”</p>

<p>Madame glanced from one to the other of us,
her face alight with amusement and her eyes with
a meaning I did not wholly understand.</p>

<p>“I shall have to command Charlotte to remain
near you then this evening, monsieur,” she said.
“In seizures of that kind it is always well to have
prompt aid at hand.”</p>

<p>I bowed my thanks. I was not yet quite sure of
my voice.</p>

<p>“And when one is subject to them,” went on
madame, “one cannot be too careful.”</p>

<p>“I have already assured mademoiselle,” I said,
“that this is absolutely the first.”</p>

<p>“Then she is very fortunate,” murmured
madame, pensively.</p>

<p>“She?” I repeated, staring at her. “I do not
understand.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me—then you are very fortunate,
monsieur;” and she smiled broadly.</p>

<p>I confess I did not yet quite catch her meaning.
I was therefore the more surprised to see my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
companion redden deeply, then rise abruptly and
walk to the other side of the room, where she
paused with her back to us to contemplate the fall
of Fribourg.</p>

<p>Madame smiled again and cast me a glance full
of meaning.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have offended her,” she said.</p>

<p>“Offended her?” I repeated in dismay. “I?”</p>

<p>“It is always an error,” she explained, “to
compel a lady to correct herself.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, madame,” I said humbly.</p>

<p>“No; beg hers,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“I do,” I said; “though I am utterly in the
dark as to the nature of my offense.”</p>

<p>“Come, Charlotte,” called madame. “Forgive
him.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried M. le Comte, appearing upon
the threshold. “Do you already stand in need
of forgiveness, Tavernay?”</p>

<p>“It seems so,” I answered, somewhat miserably.
“Certainly for my thick head and dull wits.”</p>

<p>At the words, Mlle. de Chambray ventured a
glance at me, and I saw a smile scatter the clouds.
She struggled to hold it back, to suppress it, but
quite in vain.</p>

<p>“Come, you are forgiven,” cried our host; and
it seemed to me that in his glance also there was
a hidden meaning. “I knew she was not hard of
heart. And now for dinner.”</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay,” said madame, “to you I
shall confide Charlotte—or should I put it the
other way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Either way pleases me immensely, madame,”
I said, bowing.</p>

<p>“You must know,” madame continued, “M.
de Tavernay is subject to sudden seizures of the
heart, and that Charlotte is the only one present
who can work a cure.”</p>

<p>“Our friend is not the first to be so afflicted,”
laughed M. le Comte, crossing to his wife’s side.
“Luckily I also found the one person who could
work a cure.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” protested Mlle. de Chambray,
very red. “M. de Tavernay was really suffering
acutely.”</p>

<p>“Well, so have I suffered acutely,” retorted her
tormentor. “Did I not, madame?”</p>

<p>“Or pretended to,” rejoined madame. “With
that disease it is often impossible to tell where
reality leaves off and pretense begins; you men
have made so close a study of the symptoms. But
come, monsieur; the dinner waits.”</p>

<p>I confess that the arm I gave my partner was
not so steady as I could have wished it; for my
heart was torn between delight and despair—delight
that she should be there beside me, despair
at my own stupidity in understanding so little of
all this; but I managed by some miracle to enter
the dining-room without accident, to get her safely
seated and to seat myself beside her.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath of relief when I found
myself in port.</p>

<p>“You have never been to Paris, M. de Tavernay?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
asked a low voice at my elbow, and I
looked up to find her eyes on mine.</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I stammered.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not even to Orléans?” and I saw
again in their depths that glimmer of mischief.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, not heeding it as a wise man
would. “I have passed all my life upon our
estate at Beaufort.”</p>

<p>“Something told me so!” she murmured, and
turned to her plate as innocently as though she
were quite unconscious of having planted a
poniard in my bosom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="small">A SCENT OF DANGER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I bore</span> the blow with such stoicism as I possessed,
and even made some show of listening and
laughing at M. le Comte’s account of our meeting
and subsequent reconciliation. Both women were
unaffectedly delighted with the story, which,
indeed, was told with a wit and spirit quite beyond
my reproduction. As I write these lines I am
again impressed with the wide difference between
the awkward country boy who sat scowling in that
pleasant company and the accomplished and finished
gentleman who did so much to entertain it.
For I know now that my assumption of ease and
interest could have deceived no one. All of us,
I think, looking back over the mistakes and gaucheries
of our youth must feel our cheeks crimson
more than once; certainly mine grow red when
I think upon the sorry figure I made that evening.
But when I started to set this history upon paper
I determined not to spare myself, nor will I.</p>

<p>“But who could have sent the message?” asked
madame when M. le Comte had finished the story.</p>

<p>“I cannot even guess,” he answered.</p>

<p>“How was it delivered to you? How came
you to believe it?”</p>

<p>“I believed it,” he explained, “because it was
brought to me by one of our old servants—Laroche—whom
I left in charge of the stables.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Ah, true,” murmured madame. “Laroche
disappeared a week ago. I fancied he had run
away to join the Revolutionists.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did,” said her husband quietly.</p>

<p>Madame looked at him with a start of alarm.</p>

<p>“The Revolutionists?” she repeated. “It was
they who sent the message? But why? What was
their object? Ah, I know,” she added with sudden
conviction. “It was to deprive the Vendéans of
your sword, in order that they might be defeated.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte smiled as he looked down into her
fond, admiring eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear,” he said, “my sword is not so
powerful as that. The Vendéans will win their
battles just the same without me. I think the
message was merely the bait for a trap——”</p>

<p>“From which you have escaped!” she cried
triumphantly, and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed; but there was still in his
face a certain anxiety which she perceived.</p>

<p>“What is it, Henri?” she demanded. “You
are not now in danger?”</p>

<p>He threw off his preoccupation with a laugh of
genuine amusement.</p>

<p>“In danger?” he repeated. “No—or at least
the only danger to which I am exposed at this
moment, madame, is that of falling in love with
you more violently than ever.”</p>

<p>“For shame, sir!” she cried, blushing like a
girl. “You forget that we are not alone.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” he retorted, “I think our
example a most excellent one for our young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
friends yonder;” and he looked across at us with
beaming face, and with a meaning in his eyes
which I tried in vain to fathom. “I hope they
will profit by it.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur! Monsieur!” protested madame,
restraining him, yet unable to preserve a stern
countenance.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, laughing more and more,
“it delights me to confuse that pert young lady
sitting opposite us yonder—to make her blush,
as she is doing at this moment,—and I swear, so
is Tavernay! What a pair of children! If their
parents had only had the good judgment to betroth
them——”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” interrupted madame, more
sharply. “You will not break your promise.
There was to be no word——”</p>

<p>“And I will say none; pardon me,” broke in
M. le Comte. “The temptation was very great;
and I hate to see a fellow-man barred out from
Paradise;” and he looked at me, still laughing.</p>

<p>But I bent above my plate, all pleasure in the
meal struck from me, for suddenly I found myself
groaning beneath my burden. Barred out from
Paradise—how apt the words were!—and with
bars that could never be removed. Ah, yes, if our
parents——</p>

<p>“What is it, monsieur?” asked a low voice at
my side, and I raised my eyes to find myself
gazing into the depths of those I loved. “You
sighed,” she added, seeing that I did not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Did I?” I said, wondering somewhat that she
remained so unruffled by the fire of raillery which
had been turned upon her. “One is apt to sigh
when there is something one desires very much
and yet may not possess.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help you,” she suggested, and I
saw again in her eyes that light which should have
set me on my guard. “If it is my smelling-bottle——”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I answered, with dignity.
“I do not need it.”</p>

<p>“So you refuse to confide in me, even when I
offer you my aid?”</p>

<p>“I fear you cannot aid me, mademoiselle; and
if any one in the world could, it would be you.”</p>

<p>“I am not fond of riddles, M. de Tavernay; and
it seems to me that you have just propounded one.”</p>

<p>“I spoke very seriously,” I said, “and as plainly
as I could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean it is my wits which are deficient!
I must say, monsieur——”</p>

<p>“I meant nothing of the sort,” I protested. “I
meant——”</p>

<p>“No matter,” she broke in. “Nothing is so
wearisome as to have to explain one’s meaning—unless
it be to listen to the explanation. I am sure
it argues dulness somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I bore you,” I retorted, stung
to a sort of desperation. “I had hoped that I
might at least continue to furnish you amusement.”</p>

<p>“Really,” she cried, casting me a brilliant
glance, “not a bad <i>riposte</i>. Come, we are quits,
then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“With all my heart,” I agreed; “especially
since you have removed your button.”</p>

<p>“Well, finish it,” she cried, her eyes dancing.
“Finish it.”</p>

<p>“While I am too gallant to follow your
example,” I added, relentlessly.</p>

<p>“Good!” she applauded. “<i>Touché!</i> I assure
you, monsieur, you are not boring me in the least.
All you need is a little practise, a little more assurance—you
hesitate, as all beginners do, to drive
the point home——”</p>

<p>“I am not bloodthirsty,” I interrupted. “On
the contrary, I am of a disposition the most
amiable.”</p>

<p>“And there is still about you a slight clumsiness,”
she went on, not heeding me, “a lack of
style and finish.”</p>

<p>“Remember, I have never been to Paris,” I
reminded her, “nor even to Orléans.”</p>

<p>“I shall not remember it long, for there will
soon be nothing about you to suggest it.”</p>

<p>I bowed my thanks.</p>

<p>“Especially if I may remain near you,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh that—of course!” she agreed. “Well,
you have my permission, and you will find M. le
Comte most hospitable; so remain, unless this
mysterious business of yours is imperative.”</p>

<p>“It is,” I said, my face clouding again. “I
must set out at daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Ungallant man!” she retorted, looking at me
with sparkling eyes. “Do you ask a favor only
to refuse it? Do you understand what you are
saying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Only too well, mademoiselle,” I murmured
desolately; “and I would rather have cut off my
right hand than utter those words.”</p>

<p>“Still the riddle!” she cried, with a gesture of
despair. “Really, monsieur, you weary me.
Whatever it is you desire, I advise you to ask for
it. One gets nothing in this world without asking—and
if it is refused, taking it just the same.”</p>

<p>“But when one may neither ask nor take,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, then,” she retorted, with a shrug of the
shoulders, “one is certainly in a bad way. One
would better stop desiring;” and she turned her
shoulder to me in the most impudent manner possible
and gave her attention to M. le Comte.</p>

<p>“It is La Vendée which will re-establish
monarchy in France,” he was saying, his face
alight. “Those peasants are unconquerable.
There are two hundred thousand of them, peaceful
men, tilling the soil, tending their herds, as they
had always done, with no thought of resisting the
Republic until the Republic attempted to take from
them their priests and to draft them forth to
fight on the frontiers. Then they rose as one
man, fell upon their oppressors, routed them, cut
them to pieces among the hedges. Now they are
back in their homes again to make their Easter;
that over, they will march against Thouars and
Saumur.”</p>

<p>“But, M. le Comte,” I protested, forgetting
for a moment my own troubles in the interest of
the narrative, “fighting of that sort can be successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
only near home and in a most favorable
country. For a campaign troops must have
organization.”</p>

<p>“That is true, my friend,” he agreed. “Well,
these troops are being organized. Once the
Bocage is free of the Blues, which will be within
the month, our army will be ready to cross the
Loire, take Nantes, advance through Brittany,
Normandy, and Maine, where we shall be well
received, and at last march at the head of a united
north-west against Paris itself! I tell you, Tavernay,
the Republic is doomed!”</p>

<p>His eyes were sparkling, his face flushed with
excitement. An electric shock seemed to run
around the board, and madame sprang to her feet,
glass in hand.</p>

<p>“The King!” she cried, and as we rose to drink
the toast I had a vision of a boy of twelve issuing
triumphantly from the gate of the Temple to
avenge his murdered father.</p>

<p>“And may God protect him!” added M. le
Comte, as we set our glasses down.</p>

<p>There was gloom for a moment in our hearts,
and I at least felt the stark horror of the Revolution
as I had never done. I saw more clearly its
blood-guiltiness, its red madness. For in our quiet
home at Beaufort the delirium of Paris had seemed
far away, almost of another age and country.</p>

<p>We had shuddered at the stories of the September
massacres, but only as one shudders at any
tale of horror; even yet we scarcely believed that
the King was really dead. It seemed impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that such things could happen. Just as the body
pushed beyond a certain limit of pain grows numb
and suffers no more, so the mind after a certain
time refuses to be impressed. It was thus with
the reports which came from Paris, as one followed
another, each more terrible than the last.
Not even the actors in that hideous drama comprehended
what was passing there; they were but
chips in a maelstrom, hurled hither and thither,
utterly powerless to stay or to direct the flood
which hurried them on and finally sucked them
down.</p>

<p>We of Beaufort were far off the beaten track,
and of too little consequence to cause the tide of
revolution to sweep in our direction; so it had
passed us by at such a distance that we had caught
only the faint, confused murmur of it. True, our
peasants had for the most part deserted us; our
fields were untilled, our flocks untended. There
was no money in the till and little meat in the
larder. But personally we had experienced no
danger, and expected none. We had been content
to sit quietly by while France wrought out her
destiny, pitying those less fortunate than ourselves,
and happy in the safety which our obscurity won
for us.</p>

<p>Now I was suddenly brought face to face with
the question, What was my duty? Was it to stay
at home and permit these scoundrels to have their
way unquestioned? Was it not rather to join the
army of La Vendée and add my atom to its
strength, to do what in me lay to render that campaign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
against the cannibals at Paris not a dream
but a reality? For at last I understood. Those
hideous tales were true. The fair land of France
lay at the mercy of the vilest of her people——</p>

<p>“Still pondering the riddle?” asked my companion;
and I turned to find her again regarding
me with a provoking scrutiny.</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I said. “I was thinking
that when M. le Comte rides back to the Bocage
I will accompany him.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed a swift approval.</p>

<p>“That is a man’s place!” she said. “That is
where I would be, were I a man!”</p>

<p>“You will wish me God-speed, then?” I
questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes—provided, of course,” she added, looking
at me searchingly, “that you are free to go.”</p>

<p>“Free to go!” I repeated, and my chin fell on
my breast. What instinct was it gave her this
power to stab home whenever she chose?</p>

<p>“Then you are not free to go?” she queried,
eyeing me still more closely.</p>

<p>“I confess,” I stammered, “that it was not to
don a white cockade I left Beaufort.”</p>

<p>“But surely any mere personal matter of business
may be put aside when one’s country calls!”</p>

<p>“Alas!” I murmured, “this is not an affair of
that nature.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said coolly, “you must of course
decide for yourself, monsieur; more especially
since you seem to wish to shroud yourself in a
veil of mystery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Mademoiselle,” I said desperately, “I should
like your advice.”</p>

<p>“But I understand nothing of the matter.”</p>

<p>“You shall understand, if you will do me the
honor to hear me.”</p>

<p>“Would not M. le Comte’s advice be of more
service?” she asked with a sudden trepidation
which surprised me.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, decidedly, “not in this instance.
I hope you will not refuse me.”</p>

<p>She glanced at my anxious face and smiled
curiously.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she assented. “Proceed, then.”</p>

<p>“O, not here!” I protested, with a glance at the
others. “Perhaps after dinner, mademoiselle, you
will walk with me in the garden.”</p>

<p>“In the garden?” she repeated, in an astonished
tone, and looked at me with lifted brows.</p>

<p>“I know that it is a great favor I am asking,”
I continued hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is more than that,” she broke in sharply.
“It is not convenable. What strange customs you
must have at Beaufort, monsieur! Are the young
ladies there accustomed to grant such requests?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” I answered miserably. “I
have never before preferred such a one. I am not
familiar with etiquette—with the nice rules of conduct.
If I have done wrong, forgive me.”</p>

<p>I saw her glance at me quickly from the corner
of her eye, and my heart grew bolder.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful garden,” I went on. “I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
it this evening from my window. There are
paths, seats——”</p>

<p>“I am familiar with the garden, monsieur,” she
interposed dryly.</p>

<p>“And the moon will be full to-night,” I concluded.</p>

<p>“The more reason I should refuse you,” she
retorted. “It will be a dangerous place. Though
I am amply able to take care of myself,” she
added.</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it, mademoiselle,” I agreed
humbly, “especially with me. That has already
been proved, has it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a queer little smile; “yes,
I think it has.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, it is not a ruse,” I added earnestly,
“even were I capable of a ruse, which I am not.
God knows I should like to walk with you there,
but not to tell you what I shall to-night have to
tell you.”</p>

<p>She looked at me again with a strange mixture
of timidity and daring.</p>

<p>“Very well, M. de Tavernay,” she said at last.
“In the garden then—provided, of course, that
madame consents.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said, my heart warm with gratitude.
“Shall I ask her?”</p>

<p>“No; I will attend to that;” and she smiled a
little as she glanced across the board. “But I
know that it is not discreet; I am falling a victim
to my curiosity. You have piqued it most successfully.
Although I can never solve a riddle for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
myself, I cannot rest until I know the solution. I
hope your riddle will be worth the risk.”</p>

<p>“It will,” I assured her; and fell silent, nerving
myself for the task which lay before me.</p>

<p>“But will you hear what this tyrant is saying?”
cried madame—“that I must leave the château to
dwell amid the fogs of England——”</p>

<p>“Or beneath the blue skies of Italy,” said M.
le Comte. “Really, madame, I fear the château
is no longer safe for you. The Revolution is
looking this way—and not with friendly eyes.”</p>

<p>“Does the Revolution, then, make war on
women?”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten Mlle. de Lamballe?”</p>

<p>Madame went white at the retort, almost brutal
in its brevity.</p>

<p>“But that was the <i>canaille</i> of Paris,” she protested.
“There are no such monsters here in
Poitou.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear,” said her husband, sadly, “I
fear there are monsters of the same sort wherever
there are suffering and degraded men and women.
And since it is us they blame for their suffering
and degradation, it is upon us they try to avenge
themselves. Besides, since the Republicans are
trying to entrap me, they will doubtless end by
coming here; and not finding me, they may throw
you into prison as the surest way of causing me
to suffer.”</p>

<p>“We have the tower!” cried madame. “We
will defend ourselves!”</p>

<p>“The tower was not built to withstand artillery,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her husband pointed out; “and even if the
Republicans have no cannon they need only camp
about it and bide their time to starve you into
surrender, since you could expect no aid from any
quarter.”</p>

<p>“But to leave the château—to abandon it to
pillage—oh, I could never endure it!”</p>

<p>“Better that than to lose it and our lives
together. Yes, decidedly, you must set out to-morrow——”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” echoed madame, in despairing
tones.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay will accompany you as far as
Poitiers. At Poitiers, Mlle. de Chambray——”</p>

<p>“Charlotte goes with me to Italy, do you not,
my dear? It was arranged, you know, that you
should remain with me.”</p>

<p>“I do not know, madame,” Charlotte stammered,
turning very red. “I—I think perhaps I
would better stop at Chambray.”</p>

<p>For some reason which I could not fathom both
monsieur and madame burst into a peal of laughter,
while my companion turned an even deeper
crimson.</p>

<p>“As you will,” said her hostess when she had
taken breath. “I myself think that you might do
worse, happy as I would be to have you with me.”</p>

<p>“Why cannot you stop at Chambray also,
madame?” questioned Charlotte, her face slowly
regaining its normal hue. “At least until you
find some friend also bound for Italy? You will
be quite safe at Chambray.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>M. le Comte nodded.</p>

<p>“She is right, my dear,” he said. “Accept,
and thank her. No one will look for you there—besides,
it is not for you they are searching, but
for me.”</p>

<p>“And where will you be, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“I shall be in the Bocage,” he answered simply,
“fighting the enemies of France.”</p>

<p>Madame bit her lips to restrain their trembling,
as she cast upon him a glance full of love and pride.</p>

<p>“That is where I would be also,” she said, “if
the choice were mine. Madame de la Rochejaquelein
accompanies her husband.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” he assented, “and she is sometimes
frightfully in the way. If you knew that
country, my love, you would see how impossible it
is for women. Besides, I am not Rochejaquelein—I
am not a leader, but a follower. I must go
where I am ordered, and at once, without question.
I shall fight better—I shall be worth more—knowing
that you are in safety.”</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur,” she said, her eyes shining.
“As you will. You know best.”</p>

<p>He seized her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“We shall have many happy days together,”
he said, “when the fight is won.”</p>

<p>And as I looked at them I fancied that happy
future already realized.</p>

<p>“You perceive, M. de Tavernay,” he smiled,
catching my eyes, “that though I have the honor
to be this lady’s husband, I have never ceased to
be her lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Indeed, that is not wonderful, M. le Comte,”
I said, with a glance at the adoring face beside
him. “Anything else is inconceivable.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, monsieur!” cried madame.
“You have the tongue of a courtier.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, madame,” I protested, “that
came from the heart.”</p>

<p>She laughed as she rose to her feet, and held
out her hand to me with a quick little pressure of
the fingers.</p>

<p>“Do not be long,” she said. “We women will
be lonely.”</p>

<p>I held back the drapery at the door for her
and watched her as she passed—the beautiful,
fair head, set imperiously upon the slender neck;
the little ear, pink-tinted; the rounded, perfect
arm——</p>

<p>Then another vision passed and eclipsed the
first one, though all I caught of it was a glance
from a pair of eyes dancing with mischief.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay,” said my host, coming up
behind me and placing his hand affectionately
upon my shoulder, “I confess to you that I do
not wish to sit nodding here over the wine. I
had not seen my wife for near a month, until a
few hours ago; after to-morrow it may be that
I shall never see her again. I know you will
pardon me when I say that I cannot bear the
thought of spending one moment of this night
away from her.”</p>

<p>“I beg of you to say no more,” I protested.
“I too wish to join the ladies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“I knew it!” he laughed; then his face sobered
as he looked at me. “Come, my friend, I am
going to speak to you frankly. It is a wonderful
chance which brought you here to meet Charlotte;
I cannot tell you how wonderful—you will learn
for yourself some day. Make the most of it. She
is a woman worth winning—but you have seen
that. What perhaps you have not seen—since
there are no eyes so blind as a lover’s—is that
she may be won.”</p>

<p>I caught a deep breath—a breath as much of
agony as of joy.</p>

<p>“You think so?” I murmured. “You think
so?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it!” he said, and wrung my
hand. “Good luck to you! Remember,” he
added laughing, “a fortress of that sort is never
to be taken by siege—it must be carried by
assault!” and he led the way into the drawing-room.</p>

<span class="small">I MAKE MY CONFESSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I looked</span> blindly about the room, with M. le
Comte’s words ringing in my brain, and for a
moment I did not see her. Then my eyes found
her where she stood in the embrasure of a window,
half concealed by the draperies. She was gazing
out across the garden at the rising moon and she
did not hear my approach until I had come quite
near; then she looked up at me with a glance so
soft, so caressing, that my heart leaped with a
sudden suffocating rapture.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is you,” she said, and passed her hand
hastily before her eyes. “I was not expecting
you so soon.”</p>

<p>“The wine had no attractions for either M. le
Comte or myself,” I answered, a little hoarsely.
“I have come to claim your promise.”</p>

<p>Without replying, she drew aside the curtain
and stepped through the window upon a gravelled
walk. I followed her with pulse throbbing
strangely. Madame had consented then—I had
scarcely dared hope it. But the whole adventure
had about it something so strange, so unusual,
that I had long since ceased to wonder at it, or
to try to understand it. That madame should
consent, almost as if we were betrothed, as if all
this were a family arrangement—and then my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
heart grew chill at thought of the task that lay
before me. For I knew that this was the last
time that I should ever walk in this garden, or in
any garden, with this sweet woman at my side.</p>

<p>The yellow moon was just peeping over the
tree-tops to the east, and a soft breeze stirred
the leaves upon the branches. Somewhere in the
distance a thrush was calling to its mate. The
night seemed made for love.</p>

<p>Still without speaking she led the way along the
path, past the old tower, to a seat of marble
gleaming white amid a setting of evergreens.</p>

<p>“Now I am ready to hear you, monsieur,” she
said, and sank into one corner of the seat.</p>

<p>I took a turn up and down the path to compose
myself somewhat, to quiet the painful throbbing
of my heart. How I longed to sit there beside
her—to whisper in her ear, to tell her——</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I began finally, pausing before
her, “believe me, it is not an easy task which I
have set myself, nor one which I would choose to
face could it be shirked with honor. But since
I must face it—since there is no other way—I
shall try to do so with such courage as I possess.”</p>

<p>“A most disconcerting preamble,” she commented.
“I tremble at what will follow. If it
is so formidable perhaps, after all, you would
better take M. le Comte for your confidant.”</p>

<p>“M. le Comte has no concern in it.”</p>

<p>“And I have?” she asked, looking at me
quickly with a little shrinking of alarm.</p>

<p>“Indirectly—yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Oh,” she said with a breath of relief. “Extremely
indirectly, I should say!”</p>

<p>“Besides,” I added, “I wish you to advise me—and
your advice will be worth much more to me
than M. le Comte’s, or any other’s.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; although that sounds somewhat
as if it were a continuation of the riddle. Pray
continue.”</p>

<p>“It is necessary that I should go back a little,”
I explained. “Thirty years ago my father made
a pilgrimage to Mont Saint-Michel to discharge
a vow. As he approached the rock across the
sands he was suddenly conscious that his horse
was having difficulty in proceeding. In a moment
more the horse had sunk to his belly and my father
perceived that he had blundered into a quicksand.
He flung himself from the saddle, and
abandoning the beast to its fate,—which indeed
nothing could have averted,—endeavored to make
his way back to solid ground. He sank to his
ankles, to his knees, to his waist. His struggles
to escape served only to entangle him more deeply,
until at last, seeing them in vain, he set himself
to await the end courageously. He glanced
around over the sands to make sure that there was
no help in sight, then he turned his face toward
the cross above the rock and commended his soul
to God.</p>

<p>“But the moment he ceased to struggle he
robbed the quicksand of its violence. He still
sank indeed, but so slowly that at the end of an
hour the sand had scarcely reached his breast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
He reckoned that it would be three hours at least
before the sand covered nose and mouth, but he
knew that the tide would end it before that.
Nevertheless, hope began to revive a little and
again he looked around for aid, but he had evidently
wandered some distance from the road,
and the only persons passing were so far away
that they did not perceive him nor hear his shouts.
So again he resigned himself, and the thought
even came to him to renew his struggles in order
to bring the end more quickly. But he decided
that this would be cowardly, if not sinful, and so
waited quietly. He was relieved to see that his
horse, struggling to the last, had sunk from sight,
so that its sufferings were ended.</p>

<p>“He closed his eyes and even dozed a little,
for he had been exhausted by his previous efforts,
but he was startled wide awake by a voice shouting.
The sand had reached his armpits. His
arms, extended in front of him, were covered.
He turned his head with difficulty and saw a man
standing at the edge of the quicksand. He was
tearing off his doublet in desperate haste.</p>

<p>“‘Do not venture into it!’ my father cried,
comprehending his purpose. ‘I am past saving.
Do not endanger yourself. Take a message for
me—that is all I ask.’</p>

<p>“The other did not answer, but spread out his
cloak before him and advanced across it. He
sank somewhat, it is true, but his feet were not
entangled in the sand. At the edge of his cloak
he spread his doublet, stepped upon it and drew his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
cloak after him. But that moment almost proved
his ruin, for he had sunk nearly to his knees
before he got his cloak spread out again. My
father watched him with bated breath as he freed
himself and crept forward to the edge of it.</p>

<p>“‘Your hand,’ said the stranger; and he
stretched out his own.</p>

<p>“My father disentangled one of his arms and
grasped the hand extended to him.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ continued the other rapidly, ‘you
must free yourself by one supreme effort. If we
fail the first time it will be useless to try again.
So we must not fail. Are you ready?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said my father, and with a mighty
effort heaved himself up out of the sand. Yet he
must have failed, must have sunk deeper than
ever, but for that strong arm which helped him,
drawing him up and forward to the edge of the
cloak, which formed for a moment a little isle of
safety.</p>

<p>“But only for a moment. Already the sand
was pouring over its edges and it was being
rapidly engulfed.</p>

<p>“‘We must get back without it,’ said the unknown.
‘Come.’</p>

<p>“Of the desperate struggle which followed my
father never told me much—indeed I doubt if he
remembered its details very clearly. They aided
each other, encouraged each other, drew each
other forward—each determined that the other
should be saved—and at the end dropped exhausted,
side by side, on the firm sand beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“My father’s rescuer was a young man of
Poitiers—the younger son of a good family—and
his name was Louis Marie de Benseval.”</p>

<p>I paused. I was indeed somewhat overcome
by my own story, and more especially by the
memories which it evoked. As for Mlle. de
Chambray, she sat with her face so in the shadow
that I could scarcely discern her features. She
made no comment, only stirred slightly, and I
saw her eyes shining up at me.</p>

<p>“I fear I have been prolix,” I said. “I have
wearied you. I will try to hasten——”</p>

<p>“Please do not,” she broke in. “You have not
wearied me. I wish to hear the whole story. But
will you not sit down?” and she made a little
inviting gesture.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, resisting it. “I have not yet
come to the difficult part. If I should sit there
beside you I fear that my courage would fail me.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” she murmured, and leaned still
farther into the shadow.</p>

<p>“The two became fast friends,” I continued.
“Indeed, friend is scarcely the word with which
to describe their affection—it is not strong enough.
They were more than friends. Their attachment
had a rare, abiding quality—whether they were
apart or together, it was just the same. They
determined to perpetuate it by knitting their two
families into one. They agreed that should one
of them have a son and the other a daughter,
these two should be considered betrothed from the
cradle. And it would seem that Nature, Providence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
God, approved of this design, for it so
fell out.</p>

<p>“When I was ten years old my father was
seized with a fever from which it was soon evident
he could not recover. M. de Benseval
hastened to him, bringing with him his daughter,
a child of eight. We were betrothed beside my
father’s bed. It was agreed that on the day that
I was twenty-one I should set out from Beaufort
to claim my bride. My father died blessing us,
and very happy.”</p>

<p>Again I paused, for my voice was no longer
wholly steady. Nor did I relish the story I had
yet to tell. But I nerved myself to do it.</p>

<p>“After that I lived with my mother upon our
estate at Beaufort—a small estate, but one which
under my father’s management had sufficed for
our support. At first everything went well; but
a woman, however capable, is not a man, and my
mother was more engrossed in her son than in
her fields. So our fortunes dwindled from year
to year, and the Revolution, which robbed us of
our peasants, struck them the final blow. We
were at the end of our resources, and a month
ago my mother wrote to M. de Benseval, at Poitiers,
stating our circumstances frankly and releasing
him from his engagement. In reply came a
terse note saying that his engagement was with
the dead, not with the living, and so was doubly
sacred; that on the day that I was twenty-one he
would expect me to set out for Poitiers, where his
daughter would be awaiting me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“And then?” asked my companion in a voice
which seemed a little tremulous.</p>

<p>“Well, mademoiselle, yesterday I was twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“And you set out as M. de Benseval commanded?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Joyfully, no doubt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, joyfully—why attempt to conceal it? I
told myself that I was going to execute my
father’s last command, that he was looking down
upon me with approving eyes. So I was very
happy.”</p>

<p>“You have forgotten another reason for that
happiness, have you not, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Another reason?”</p>

<p>“You have said nothing of the lady.”</p>

<p>“Really, mademoiselle,” I said in some confusion,
“I fear I scarcely thought of her. I was
only a boy. I had never been out into the world.
All women were the same to me.”</p>

<p>“You mean they are no longer so?” she asked,
and again I saw her eyes gleaming up at me from
the shadow.</p>

<p>“So little so, mademoiselle,” I answered
hoarsely, “that I am longing to throw myself
into the war in La Vendée in the hope that a
kindly bullet will deliver me from the fate prepared
for me. Death, it seems to me, is preferable
to that a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur,” she protested lightly, “you
exaggerate. Indeed, I can assure you that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
month from now you will again find life very
tolerable.”</p>

<p>“Why a month from now?”</p>

<p>“Because in that time you will be married, you
will have become accustomed to your wife, your
heart will have opened to her, and you will have
forgotten the mood of this evening—or if you
recall it, it will be with a smile of amusement,
as at a boyish folly.”</p>

<p>“You may think so perhaps,” I said, bitter that
I should be so misunderstood.</p>

<p>“You ask for my advice,” she retorted, “and
yet you grow angry when I give it. Shall I not
say what I believe?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” I begged, “but you do not yet
understand. I have told you that I have passed
my whole life with my mother—for me she was
the only woman in the world.”</p>

<p>“And now?” she asked. I could have sworn
that she was luring me on but for the gross absurdity
of such a thought.</p>

<p>“Now there is still only one woman, mademoiselle,
but it is not the same one,” I answered
simply.</p>

<p>To this for a moment she found no reply, but
sat gazing out at the river with pensive eyes. The
moon had risen above the tree-tops, seeking her;
and finding her at last, caressed and threw a halo
round her. I turned a little giddy at her pure,
transcendent beauty, and my heart hungered for
her.</p>

<p>At last she roused herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Well, monsieur,” she said, “now that perhaps
I understand a little better, do you still desire
my advice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle; more than I can say.”</p>

<p>“Not, I hope, as to whether you should prove
false to this betrothal?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!—there can be no question of that.
That is a matter which concerns not my honor
alone, but that of my father also.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented; “M. de Benseval was
right—the engagement is with the dead, and so is
doubly sacred. So far we are agreed. What is
it, then, that you propose?”</p>

<p>“I propose to turn aside from my journey to
Poitiers, and follow M. le Comte back to the
Bocage. Can I do this with honor, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“What will you do in the Bocage?”</p>

<p>“I will seek death,” I answered; and I know
that I spoke sincerely. “And it may be that my
death will be of some service to France.”</p>

<p>She sat a moment looking up at me, a strange
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I do not like to advise,” she began at last, and
I fancied that her lips were trembling. “It is so
serious a matter.”</p>

<p>“I beg you to,” I urged. “It is the greatest
favor you can do me.”</p>

<p>“A man is the best judge of his own duty.”</p>

<p>“He should be,” I admitted; “but in this case
I fear that I cannot see clearly.”</p>

<p>“But neither may I,” she objected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Ah, I am sure you will; in fact, mademoiselle,
I suspect that you see so clearly that you fear to
wound me. But to refuse to help me would be
to wound me far more deeply.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she said, a little hoarsely, “since
you will have it so, I must tell you that to my
mind your betrothed has the first claim upon you.
Not until you have fulfilled your engagement with
her,—the engagement for which your father has
your word,—is your life your own to cherish or
throw away; not even then, for surely she will
have some claim upon it.”</p>

<p>“Not so great a claim as my country,” I
protested.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” she assented; “but at present
her claim is greater than your country’s. To
desert her would be to dishonor her; a betrothal
is a sacred thing, almost as sacred as marriage
itself. To break it, to cast it aside, to disregard
it even for a time, would be cowardly and ignoble.
You must go on to Poitiers. That way lies the
path of honor.”</p>

<p>She spoke with a simple, fearless, deep sincerity
which moved me strangely. Ah, here was
a woman! Here was a woman!</p>

<p>“You are right, mademoiselle,” I said, and bent
and kissed her hand. “A thousand times right.
I thank you.”</p>

<p>Then with such agony at my heart that I knew
not whither I went, I turned and left her.</p>

<span class="small">EVE IN THE GARDEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> that clear voice recalled me ere I had taken
a dozen steps.</p>

<p>“What is it? Whither do you go?” she asked.
“Not forward to Poitiers at this hour!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” I answered. “I was merely going
to—to think—to fight it out. But I was rude.
Pardon me. I—I did not realize what I was
doing.”</p>

<p>“You are pardoned,” she said; and her voice
was siren-sweet. “Perhaps I can help you to
fight it out, my friend—at least I should like to
help you. Besides I have not yet done talking
to you. I have some further advice at your disposal,
if you care for it.”</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> care for it,” I said; and turned instantly
back to her. “You are very kind.”</p>

<p>“I wish to be kind,” she murmured; and looked
up at me with a smile that set my head to whirling.
“But before I proceed,” she added, “you must
sit here beside me. I can’t talk to you when you
are prowling up and down like that. I feel as
though I were <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a wild animal, and
it disconcerts me.”</p>

<p>She patted the seat with an inviting hand, and
smiled again that alluring smile. I sat down obediently
and looked at her, noting how the moonlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
touched her hair with silver and gave a
strange glory to her face.</p>

<p>“Since you are betrothed to another, M. de
Tavernay,” she began, turning in the seat so
that she faced me, “doubly betrothed, with a tie
there is no breaking, and since I have satisfied
myself that you are a man of honor, I feel that
I can be quite frank with you—almost as I should
be with my own brother, did I have one. What is
it?” she asked, noticing the cloud which swept
across my countenance.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” I hastened to say. “Only
there was a sting in the words, as well as kindness.”</p>

<p>“A sting?” she repeated. “I fear you are
very thin-skinned, M. de Tavernay.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am,” I admitted humbly. “I shall
try to remedy the fault.”</p>

<p>“Do,” she urged. “But I was about to say
that you have not yet wholly explained yourself.”</p>

<p>“I think I have told the whole story,” I said,
casting my mind back over its details. “I can
think of nothing that I have omitted.”</p>

<p>She sat for a moment looking at me, her lips
parted, the color coming and going in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You said some time ago,” she went on at
last, “that I was concerned with this story—that
it was for that reason you desired my advice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have not yet explained to me what
you meant by that, my friend.”</p>

<p>A sudden trembling seized me as I met her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I thought you knew,” I began hoarsely. “I
thought you guessed.”</p>

<p>“I am not good at guessing,” she said, looking
up at me, her eyes radiant, her hands against her
heart.</p>

<p>“I meant,” I stammered, “I meant——”</p>

<p>But my lips refused to form the words; my
heart turned faint——</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, in a low voice. “I understand;”
and she played for a moment with the
rose at her bosom. “You mean, then, that it is
I who have wrought this change in you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I assented; and caught my breath to
choke back the sob which rose in my throat.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a little frown, which
changed in an instant to an arch smile.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, “confess that you are easily
impressed, and that you will forget as easily.”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget!”</p>

<p>“Remember the proverb—‘That which flames
at a touch dies at a breath.’”</p>

<p>“I care nothing for proverbs. I know my own
heart.”</p>

<p>“But consider, my friend;” and she leaned
forward in her earnestness until she almost
touched me, until the sweet glow of her body
penetrated to me. “You have known me only a
few hours. I am the first woman you have met
on riding forth into the world. You mistake a
goose for a swan. I assure you that there are
many women beside whom you would not give me
a second glance. Indeed, it is very possible that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
your betrothed may be one of them. So you
will soon recover from this madness; in a day or
two it will have quite passed away. The path of
honor leads you to Poitiers and there you will find
happiness as well. In time you will come to
wonder at this night’s emotion, and to laugh at it.
You will look back and you will say to yourself,
‘What a fool I was!’”</p>

<p>“It is true,” I said slowly, “that I may be a
fool in desiring what I can never hope to possess;
but at least, mademoiselle, do me the justice to
believe that I shall never cease to desire it. I do
not know how to tell you, for I have no skill in
the phrases of love. I only know that you have
touched in me a chord which will never cease to
beat until the heart itself is still. It is not your
beauty, though you are very beautiful; it is not the
tone of your voice, though that is very sweet; it
is not your smile, though that drives me to madness.
It is something beyond and behind all that;
it is something which for want of a better name
I call your soul—that which looks out of your eyes
so clear and pure that I tremble before it, knowing
my own unworthiness. It is your soul that I
love, mademoiselle, and no lapse of time, no chance
of fortune—nothing in earth or heaven—can
alter that love one atom.”</p>

<p>I have heard that love gives eyes to the blind,
ears to the deaf, a tongue to the dumb. I know
that at that moment, as my heart burned within
me and the words rushed unbidden to my lips, the
world appeared a small and trivial thing, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
nothing worthy in it save me and this woman
and the love I had for her. I have no words to
describe the emotion which shook me, the passion
which flowed in my veins and took possession of
my being. It was as if a sudden miracle had been
wrought in me, a sublimation of everything unworthy;
it was as though I had climbed a mountain
peak and come out under the clear stars, in
the thin pure air, with nothing between myself
and God. I have never again reached a height
quite so sublime, or experienced a bliss quite so
poignant.</p>

<p>I was too blinded for the moment by my own
emotion to see my companion clearly; only her
starry eyes I saw, and her parted lips, and her
clasped hands. Then she drew away from me and
seemed to shake herself as though awaking from
a dream; and a cold breath blew upon me, and I,
too, awoke. The spell was broken, the vision
ended, the glorious moment gone.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” she said, her voice not wholly steady,
but her eyes instinct with mischief, “it seems to
me that you are fairly eloquent, M. de Tavernay,
despite your lack of practise. I tremble to think
what you will be in a year’s time.”</p>

<p>“I shall be just what I am now,” I said doggedly,
wounded at her tone. “You have sounded
the height and depth of my eloquence.”</p>

<p>“And am I to believe all this?”</p>

<p>“If you do not, mademoiselle, it is not because
it is not true.”</p>

<p>“But your betrothed,” she persisted, “has she
no attractions?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I have not seen her since she was a child of
eight,” I answered coldly. “I remember only
that she had white hair and a red nose.”</p>

<p>She burst into a peal of laughter which shook
her from head to foot, and which I thought exceedingly
ill-timed.</p>

<p>“Many children have,” she said, when she could
speak articulately. “I should not allow such little
things as those to prejudice me against her. No
doubt her hair is darker now, and that redness of
the nose may have been only temporary. Perhaps
her memory of you is no more complimentary.”</p>

<p>“That is very likely,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“Think, then,” she cried, “how agreeably she
will be surprised when she sees you! Unless
indeed she has already lost her heart to some handsome
fellow of Poitiers.”</p>

<p>“I trust not,” I said. “I trust not.”</p>

<p>“And why?” she queried sharply.</p>

<p>“I would not wish her to be unhappy also.”</p>

<p>She sat a moment silent at that.</p>

<p>“You mean that even if she has,” she asked at
last, “you will hold her to the betrothal?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” I answered, instantly; “she would
be free—that is, if she chose to be free.”</p>

<p>“If she chose to be?”</p>

<p>“Her father would hold her to her oath,”
said I.</p>

<p>“And you believe he would have a right to do
that?” she demanded, wheeling upon me fiercely.
“You believe that he would have a right to compel
her obedience, to force her into this marriage, to
make her miserable?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Yes,” I answered, after a moment’s thought,
“I am sure he would. The law is very clear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the law!” she cried, impatiently. “I was
not thinking of the law—I care nothing for the
law—a poor, stumbling device of stupid men,
whose meaning even they do not understand!
Would he have the <i>right</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I repeated, “I believe he would. He
had passed his word.”</p>

<p>“And his word is of more importance than his
daughter’s happiness?” she demanded, her eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” I answered, feeling myself on
firm ground at last. “His honor is of more
importance to him than anything else on earth.”</p>

<p>“Honor!” she echoed, contemptuously. “An
empty word men frighten women with!”</p>

<p>“No!” I cried. “A rock to cling to in time
of storm, even as I am clinging to it now.”</p>

<p>She sat for a moment looking at me darkly.</p>

<p>“You men are all alike,” she said at last.
“Lords of creation, before whom we women must
bow in all humility.”</p>

<p>“Even as you are doing at this moment,” I
retorted.</p>

<p>She laughed at that, and the cloud vanished
from her face.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said. “After all, I was
tilting at windmills. There is small danger that
your betrothed has given her heart into another’s
keeping. More probably she is guarding it
sacredly for you. A girl has not a man’s opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
for falling in love—nor a man’s temptations.
Besides—oh, I can be frank with you, for
I feel almost like your sister!—permit me to tell
you, monsieur, that I think you a very handsome
fellow, quite capable of consoling her for the loss
of any girlish flame!”</p>

<p>I did not like the words, nor the tone in which
they were uttered. They lacked that sympathy,
that consideration, which I felt I had the right
to expect from her. Perhaps, too, my vanity
was wounded by my very evident failure to touch
her heart.</p>

<p>“You are not treating me fairly, mademoiselle,”
I said, “nor kindly.”</p>

<p>“You will pardon me,” she retorted, her face
fairly beaming, “if I fail to see the situation in
such tragic light as you. It has for me an element
of humor.”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate that I at least continue to amuse
you,” I said grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes; there are not many people who amuse
me. Besides, I am quite certain that a year hence,
when you look back at this night, you also will
be amused. I am flattered by your passion, since
it proves that under certain favorable circumstances
I am not devoid of attraction. But I
should be extremely foolish to take it seriously—more
especially since you are already betrothed.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” I assented bitterly. “I am a
coward to try to entangle you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will not entangle me,” she answered
easily. “I shall take good care to keep a tight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
grip on my heart. But all that does not prevent
me liking you immensely, M. de Tavernay. I
have often wished,” she went on, gazing at me
from under half-closed lashes in a most provoking
fashion, “that it were possible for me to have as a
friend a man in whom I could wholly trust—a
man young enough to understand the illusions of
youth—young enough not to adopt toward me
that paternal attitude which I detest—one whose
kindness and sympathy I could always count upon
and in whom I could confide. But I told myself
that such a wish could never be fulfilled; that such
friendships were too dangerous, that such a man
did not exist. And yet, behold, here I have found
him and he is bound in such a manner that there
is no danger for either of us.”</p>

<p>“I would not be too sure of that, mademoiselle,”
I interrupted. “The bonds have not yet
been forged which could not somehow be broken.”</p>

<p>“But bonds of honor!” she protested. “It
is your word!”</p>

<p>“Yes, even those! There is a limit to endurance;”
and I gripped my hands together to keep
them away from her.</p>

<p>“Well, that limit shall not be passed, M. de
Tavernay,” she assured me, her lips breaking into
a smile, and, quite regardless of her danger, she
leaned nearer to me. “Besides I have a deep confidence
in you. The sentiments you have to-night
expressed completely reassure me—I see now how
foolish I was to think there could be any risk in
coming here with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>It was a two-edged compliment and I did not
relish it, but she was gazing up at me with eyes so
guileless and trusting that I choked back the words
which rose in my throat. Perhaps, had I been
older and more experienced with women, I might
have seen the flicker of mischief which I suspect
dwelt in their depths. Guilelessness is a favorite
snare of Circe’s.</p>

<p>“Let me whisper you a secret,” she added,
leaning toward me, a little quirk at the corner of
her lips, “your betrothed is a charming girl!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know her!” I said, and stared at her
gloomily, for she seemed to delight in torturing
me.</p>

<p>“No—I have never met her—have never even
seen her,” and she laughed to herself as she uttered
the words; “but I have heard her spoken of.
With her, you will soon forget this poor Charlotte
de Chambray—you will fall in love with her even
more desperately than you have with me, and she
will make you happy.”</p>

<p>“And will you regret that, mademoiselle?” I
asked, realizing the folly of the question, but
unable to suppress it.</p>

<p>“Not in the least!” she retorted, and burst into
a peal of laughter at sight of my crestfallen countenance—though
it seemed to me that her face
showed traces of crimson, too.</p>

<p>But there is, as I had said, a limit to endurance.
Her mockery raised in me suddenly a fierce madness—a
carelessness of what might follow. I
groped for her blindly, my arms were about her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
crushing her to me with a sort of savage fury.
The mockery was gone from her eyes now; she
tried to beat me off, then, with a little sob, hid
her face upon my shoulder. But pity was not in
me, only a fierce exulting, and I raised her face, I
lifted her lips to mine and kissed them desperately,
passionately, again and again.</p>

<p>Then I released her and stood erect, my blood
on fire, a great joy at my heart.</p>

<span class="small">I DARE AND AM FORGIVEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment she did not stir, only sat there
crushed and dazed, staring straight before her, as
though not understanding what had happened.
And looking down at her my mood of exultation
in my triumph changed suddenly to one of pity
for her weakness. I had felt precisely the same
emotion many times before, when, having brought
down a bird or a rabbit by some daring or difficult
shot, I came to the spot where my victim lay
bleeding its life out. Pity for my victim always
outweighed the satisfaction which the successful
shot had given me, and I would tramp sadly home,
resolved to hunt no more.</p>

<p>So, gazing down at that bowed head, I felt
pity for her rise warm within my heart. She was
right. Men were brutes—crushing women by
their strength, pulling them down, taking their
will of them, then faring gaily on without a
thought for the shame and suffering they left
behind. So it had always been.</p>

<p>At last she looked up at me, and her eyes were
very cold.</p>

<p>“Was that the act of a gentleman?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It was not,” I said, and at my tone I saw her
start and look up at me more keenly. No doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
she had expected to hear in my voice a note of
triumph.</p>

<p>“You are ready, then, to apologize?” she continued,
after a moment.</p>

<p>“I sincerely beg your pardon, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“You see I was wrong to trust you—to come
here into the garden with you. But I thought
you a man of honor!”</p>

<p>“I thought myself so,” I said.</p>

<p>“And your excuse?”</p>

<p>“I was tempted and I fell.”</p>

<p>“That has been man’s retort since the days of
Adam!” she said with scorn. “A retort which
I consider ungenerous and ungentlemanly.”</p>

<p>“Well, it has not been without some justification,”
I said, my spirits rising, as I saw that here,
at least, was a victim capable of self-defense.
“But I apologize.”</p>

<p>“You promise that the act shall never be repeated?”
she asked with great severity.</p>

<p>“I promise that freely.”</p>

<p>“But will you keep the promise? You see I
have a reason to distrust you, M. de Tavernay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will keep it,” I said. “I have the
memory of this night to live on;” and my heart
warmed at the thought. “Always I shall have
the memory of this night to live on!”</p>

<p>She flushed slightly and her eyes softened and
wavered, but only for an instant.</p>

<p>“And what of your loyalty to your betrothed?”
she queried with biting irony.</p>

<p>But even that failed to wound me, to pierce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
garment of joy in which I was once again
enveloped.</p>

<p>“It shall never again be broken,” I said. “But
nothing she can do will change the past.”</p>

<p>“You mean you would not have it changed?”</p>

<p>“No!” I cried. “No! It is the dearest thing
I have. I am proud of it! I glory in it! I shall
keep it always warm against my heart.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, I suspect you are something of
a poet, M. de Tavernay?” she said, after a
moment’s inspection of my face from under half-closed
lids.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” I protested. “It is love makes me
appear so.”</p>

<p>Again she contemplated me for a moment, a
puzzling smile playing about her lips.</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur,” she said suddenly, “I am
going to be generous. Sit down again. You see,
I have faith in you. Besides, I wish to keep my
friend, if I can. After all, perhaps you <i>may</i> care
for me—although, I repeat, it is only for the
moment.”</p>

<p>“You do not really think so,” I interrupted;
“but let it pass.”</p>

<p>“Besides, you are very young.”</p>

<p>“Not so young as you, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am immensely older. I am an elder
sister who must take you in hand and form you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody wishes to form me,” I cried,
impatiently. “I have no desire to be formed—I
will form myself.”</p>

<p>“Who wished to form you?” she demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
quickly with a peremptoriness that astonished me.</p>

<p>“Why, old Dubosq,” I answered. “The fellow
who halted me just out of Tours.”</p>

<p>She breathed a sigh of relief which astonished
me even more than had her question.</p>

<p>“He was a man, that fellow,” I added. “I
should like to meet him again—a dashing rascal.”</p>

<p>“Of course—he flattered you,” she said, looking
at me coolly. “I know what he said to you
as well as though I had heard him say it.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘All you need, my friend, is a little
more polish, and you will be a perfect devil with
the ladies.’”</p>

<p>I stared at her, my mouth open, for she had
caught Dubosq’s intonation to a shade.</p>

<p>“And then he leered,” she added, “and twisted
his mustaches. But the most disgusting thing is
that you believed him, and you smirked and would
have twisted your mustaches too, but that you
are too young to have any. Oh, men are all
alike—foul, despicable creatures! And then you
come here, riding very erect, those words repeating
themselves over and over in your bosom—and
you pretend——” She broke off suddenly,
and turned upon me furiously. “Are you in
the habit of attacking young women in that
fashion?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I stammered, shrinking
from this terrific assault which touched every joint
in my armor. “I have never before kissed a
young woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>She looked at me again, caught her breath, her
hand against her heart; and then she blushed and
smiled and her eyes grew very tender. By some
miracle I had found the answer that turned away
wrath.</p>

<p>“There, M. de Tavernay,” she said, holding
out her hand impulsively, “I forgive you from my
heart. We shall be friends. And forget that
nonsense I was talking.”</p>

<p>I bent and kissed the fingers, so warm, so soft,
so fragrant.</p>

<p>“If I might have a pledge of it,” I said,
with sudden boldness. “That flower at your
breast——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she cried. “You need no pledge
of it. And now,” she added, “I must be going
in. Madame will be terribly scandalized.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not go,” I protested, and retained her
hand in mine. “Think—we may never again be
alone together—certainly never like this, in an
enchanted garden, with the moon looking down
upon us, full of counsel and encouragement.”</p>

<p>“The moon has never been noted for the wisdom
of its counsel,” she retorted; “and as for
encouragement, you certainly need none.”</p>

<p>“But give me a little longer,” I pleaded,
trembling at the thought of parting from her.
“Sit here beside me and let me look at you. Ah,
I already know every feature, every curl of the
hair. It is not at that I wish to look, but at the
soul in your eyes. I know you do not love me,
and yet it seems to me that your soul and mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
were destined for each other. I cannot really
believe that we are to be kept apart. I hear within
myself a voice which says that there can be no
happiness for me apart from you. I ask for nothing
more than to sit on here forever with you
beside me, your hand in mine.”</p>

<p>She leaned away from me into the corner of
the seat, and I fancied she shivered slightly.</p>

<p>“You are cold,” I said remorsefully. “I
have been thoughtless. The air is chilly and a
mist is rising from the river. May I get my
cloak for you?”</p>

<p>“No, M. de Tavernay,” she answered, rising to
her feet somewhat unsteadily. “I must really
leave you. Remember, we are to start for Poitiers
in the morning, and I have many things to do.”</p>

<p>It would have been selfish to protest, heartless
to expose her longer to the dampness of the night.</p>

<p>“At least,” I said, “I shall ride by the window
of the coach to-morrow, where I can still see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she laughed, “and I think I can promise
that madame will even permit you to speak to me,
if you are very good. Come.”</p>

<p>I walked beside her along the gravelled path,
drinking in her beauty, exulting in my passion,
pressing to my heart the cross which tore me.
Past the tower we went, past the hedge which
framed the garden. I paused for a last look back
at it—ah, I had spent a happy hour there!</p>

<p>“There will never be another night like this!”
I said. “Never, never can there be another night
like this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Dear garden!” my companion murmured,
and threw a kiss to it.</p>

<p>“Then you will remember it, too?” I asked,
scarce breathing.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she answered, very softly. “It is
the place where I have gained a—friend!”</p>

<p>It was not the word I had hoped for, but the
most, no doubt, I could expect. I went on beside
her, my head bowed. A friend! A friend! Ah,
it was something more than that my heart desired.</p>

<p>At last we came to the broad flight of steps
which led upward to the terrace.</p>

<p>“I must leave you here, monsieur,” she said,
and mounted a step or two, then turned and looked
down at me with eyes that glowed and glowed
with a strange inward light.</p>

<p>A mad impulse seized me to fling honor to the
winds, to throw myself upon my knees, to implore
her to flee with me somewhere—anywhere—to a
wilderness, a desert island, where there would be
only we and our love.</p>

<p>Perhaps she guessed my thought, for she smiled
tremulously and held out her hand to me very
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Take courage, my friend,” she said. “There
is a voice speaking to me also. It tells me that
fate will not be so cruel as you think; it promises
that your future shall, after all, be happy.”</p>

<p>I bent and kissed her hand with lips that
trembled so I could scarce control them. For an
instant she laid her other hand lightly upon my
head, as though in benediction, then turned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
went on up the steps. But at the top she paused,
looked down at me, leaned toward me.</p>

<p>“My love! My love!” I murmured, a mist
before my eyes.</p>

<p>She gazed down at me a moment longer—into
my eyes, into my soul. Then, with a sudden
movement, she took the rose from her bosom,
kissed it and flung it down to me with a gesture
divine, adorable. When I raised my head from the
flower she was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="small">A SERPENT IN THE GARDEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thought of entering the house revolted
me. I needed the high heavens to give room for
my happiness, the moon and the stars for confidants,
the breeze of the night to cool the fever
in my veins. To enter the house would be to
break the spell, to bring me back again to that
earth which my feet seemed scarcely to touch. So
I retraced my steps to the white seat at the end
of the garden, sat down where she had sat, and
abandoned myself to a delicious reverie. I put
all thought of the morrow from me—of the morrow
when we must separate; all thought of that
gray future which would never be brightened by
sight of her, by the light of her eyes and the smile
of her lips—all this I put away.</p>

<p>I had only to close my eyes to bring her again to
my side. What a miracle she was—what a wonder
of God’s handiwork! The clear and delicate skin,
the hair with its glint of gold, the eyes with their
arched brows and upturned lashes, the lips trembling
with sympathy or curving with scorn, the
oval chin showing just a suspicion of a dimple, the
rounded figure promising I know not what allurements
and perfections—all these I contemplated
one by one, and seemed to catch again that exquisite
<i>odeur de femme</i> which had ravished and
intoxicated me as I held her in my arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>And behind and above all this, the soul—a
woman’s soul in its delicacy and sweetness, yet
with a certain manliness about it, too, in its high
ideals, its conception of honor and duty, its
courage and devotion, its reverence for the
pledged word—something of the oak as well as
of the ivy, almost as if she had been raised among
men rather than among women, and had come to
look at the world somewhat with a man’s eye.
Yes, and there was something manlike, too, in
her independence, her impatience of convention,
her self-reliance. Not that all this destroyed or
even clouded the woman in her—that quality of
siren and coquette which is in every woman’s
blood. Rather it enhanced it, gave it a sauce and
piquancy not to be withstood.</p>

<p>For a moment she had been mine—I had dared
and been forgiven. She had been kind to me;
she had been moved by my love; she had thrown
me a flower at parting. And at thought of it, I
took it from my bosom and pressed it to my lips.
I inhaled its fragrance, which somehow seemed a
part of her; I contemplated its beauty, in which
I saw hers reflected. She had been kind to me.
I even dared to think she had been kinder yet, did
fate permit, and the thought gave me a throbbing
joy—a selfish joy, I told myself, since I had no
right to make her suffer, too.</p>

<p>Yet human nature is but an imperfect thing, and
love is selfish in its unselfishness. In my heart
of hearts I was glad—glad that she would remember
me, that she would think tenderly of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
evening in the garden, and of my kisses on her
lips. The memory thrilled through me. I thanked
God that I had been brave enough to snatch that
moment’s joy, that there was that between us!
That there would always be; no stretch of time
nor stress of circumstance could alter it—it was
woven indelibly into the texture of our lives.
Whenever she thought of me, whenever she visited
this garden, yea, whenever any other dared
speak to her of love, she must recall that moment
when I had held her close against my heart and
raised her lips to mine!</p>

<p>And I—could I kiss another woman?</p>

<p>I sat erect with a quick intaking of the breath,
for I saw in my path a new pitfall, and one of
my own digging.</p>

<p>Must I confess to my betrothed that my heart
was in another’s keeping, or did honor bid me to
keep silent, to simulate affection, to lead her to
the altar in the belief that it was she I loved?
Oh, I should not shrink from confession; and
she had the right to know—yet—yet would I not
confess in the hope that she would set me free?</p>

<p>But if she should feel as I did about this marriage,
that honor demanded its consummation, that
duty compelled her to sacrifice herself, whatever
my offenses, would not such confession merely
embitter her cup to no purpose? Yet even if I
did not confess, would I be strong enough, self-controlled
enough to cheat her woman’s eyes?</p>

<p>Here was a question not easily answered; a
dilemma the most awkward; a problem which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
felt I could not solve alone. I could only hope that
during our ride next day to Poitiers I might have
opportunity to lay it before Mlle. de Chambray.
She, I felt sure, would with her clear vision see
instantly where my duty lay.</p>

<p>So I put the problem from me and lay back in
the seat and closed my eyes and lived over again,
minute by minute, that brief, delicious evening. I
recalled every look, every word, every gesture from
the instant I had first perceived her on the
threshold of the drawing-room until that other
instant when at parting she had tossed the flower
down to me. I held it to my lips and murmured
low to it the words I had not dared to utter in
her hearing.</p>

<p>Ah, <i>mesdames et messieurs</i>, you smile, perhaps,
and shrug your shoulders! But in your own
lives has there not been some such moment? At
least I trust so! Recall it!—and remember that
I was young and ardent; remember that love had
come to me not timidly by slow steps, but with one
glorious burst of happiness, flinging wide the
gates of my heart at a single touch, as, to my
mind, love always should. But if you have had
no such moment, if you have stopped your ears
and hurried on when love called you to tarry—if
life is for you so poor, and gray, and savorless—then,
I pray you, put this tale aside, for of that
which follows you will understand not a word.
Nor indeed would I care to tell it to such an
audience.</p>

<p>How long I sat there, wrapped in this garment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of purest joy, I know not—an hour perhaps, or
even two. I was aroused by the rattle of oar in
rowlock coming from the river at my feet. I
glanced out absently across the water just as a
boat shot from the shadow of the farther shore,
crossed the strip of moonlight in mid-stream, and
disappeared again into the shadow cast by the
trees which edged the garden.</p>

<p>I saw it clearly but an instant; yet that instant
had sufficed to wake me from my abstraction,
for it showed me that the boat was weighted deep
in the water with a crowd of men who wore
about their necks the tri-colored scarf of the
Republic.</p>

<p>As I stared down at the river, trying to comprehend
the meaning of this vision, a second boat
similarly loaded followed the first.</p>

<p>I sat intent, listening to the rattle of the oars.
Then I heard the boats grate upon the gravel of
the bank and the sound of men leaving them, talking
together in voices so subdued that only a
faint murmur reached me.</p>

<p>What could it mean? What was the object of
this midnight expedition?</p>

<p>Then my heart stood still. The soldiers had
entered the garden and were advancing cautiously
in the shadow of the hedge. The grass muffled
their footsteps, but now and then gun clanked
against bayonet, or scabbard against boot. I
sat where I was, quite secure in my clump of
evergreens, straining my ears, my eyes, trying to
understand. I could just discern the squad as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
approached, halted, moved on again; and each
time it left behind it a dim figure, stationary in
the shadow. As I stared, the leader came suddenly
into a patch of moonlight. His face was
turned toward the château, and instantly I recognized
the rough countenance, the fierce mustachios
of Dubosq.</p>

<p>In a flash I understood. They were after M. le
Comte. They were posting sentries about the
house. Dubosq was making sure that this time
his quarry would not break through the trap.</p>

<p>I started to my feet, then instantly sank back
again, for the squad was almost upon me. I must
get to the house; I must warn M. le Comte; yet
to attempt it at this moment was to invite disaster,
not only for myself, but for him. I must
wait; I must watch my chance; I must get to the
house unseen. Dubosq must not suspect our
knowledge of his movements. I could picture the
fierce joy which filled him at the thought that his
hour of vengeance was at hand.</p>

<p>Still the squad came forward. At last it halted
so close behind me that I might almost have
stretched out my hand and touched the nearest
man. I crouched low in the seat and sat with
bated breath.</p>

<p>“You understand,” Dubosq’s voice said, “you
are to remain here until you hear the cry of an
owl thrice repeated. You will then advance
toward the château as quietly as possible and keeping
in touch with the other sentries. If any man
attempts to leave the house or to enter it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
refuses to halt at your challenge, do not hesitate,
but shoot him instantly.”</p>

<p>“And the women?”</p>

<p>“The women are not to be harmed—that is
imperative. They must not escape, but the man
who injures them shall answer for it.”</p>

<p>“They are aristocrats, like the others,” growled
the sentry.</p>

<p>“That is true,” agreed Dubosq; “but Citizen
Goujon hopes to convert them.”</p>

<p>“Pah!” said the fellow contemptuously. “Has
one of them ever been converted? Answer me
that, citizen!”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Dubosq, sharply, “I have given
you the orders. See that you obey them. Forward!”</p>

<p>The squad moved on past me toward the
château, and I cautiously raised my head above
the back of the seat and peered around. The
sentry had been posted so close to me that I could
hear him still growling to himself.</p>

<p>“A Septembrist!” I told myself. “A monster!
An assassin!”</p>

<p>But as I looked at him I could scarcely believe
that this was the bloodthirsty ruffian whose voice
I had listened to. He stood leaning on his musket,
staring toward the château, and a beam of light
falling full upon his face revealed a mere youth,
with features finely chiselled and the dreamy eyes
of a poet. His hair clustered about his face in
little curls, his lips were curved and sensitive as
any woman’s. I stared at him amazed; then suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
I understood. This was one of those who
fought for an ideal, who fancied that the era of
universal brotherhood was at hand, and that the
Revolution was to make it possible—one to whom
“Liberty, equality, fraternity” was not a mere
phrase, but a vision to be realized. I had heard
of such, but never until that moment had I believed
in their existence. Could it be that after
all the Revolution had in it a germ of good, a
possibility of light?</p>

<p>I shook the thought away—it was absurd to
suppose that good could spring from murder and
outrage, that light could come from a darkness so
revolting. This was not a moment for theories,
but for deeds. I must go; I must make a dash
for it. I should fall, of course. He could scarcely
miss me in that clear light. But the shot would
alarm the house, would give its occupants at least
a moment to prepare for their defense. That, at
any rate, I could accomplish.</p>

<p>I gathered myself for the spring. Just ahead of
me lay a strip of moonlit lawn—it was there that
the peril lay—it was there he would bring me
down. And the shot would precipitate the attack.</p>

<p>I paused. If there was no alarm at least twenty
minutes would be required to post the sentries and
to make sure there was no break in the chain.
Perhaps there was another and a better way.
Perhaps I could leap upon the sentry and bear him
down before he could give the alarm.</p>

<p>I raised my head cautiously and looked at him
again, measuring the distance. He was humming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the “Marseillaise,” his thoughts evidently far
away, for his eyes were lifted and he was staring
absently up at the clear heavens. Had I a dagger
I could have struck him down. But I had no
weapon; and even had there been a dagger in
my hand I doubt if I could have nerved my arm
to the blow, so pure, so youthful did he appear
at that moment—younger than I. And somehow
I understood that there in the sky he saw a face
smiling down at him.</p>

<p>I shook myself savagely and called myself a
fool. Since he had espoused the cause of murderers
he must suffer like any other—this was no
time to hesitate. Again I measured the distance
and noted his abstraction. I would be upon him
at a single bound, and, my fingers once at his
throat, I knew that he would not cry out.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the shadow back of him I fancied
I saw a deeper shadow move. I strained my eyes.
Yes!—there it was—another sentinel perhaps, and
my heart fell. And yet, why did he advance so
slowly, why did he crouch so near the earth? Was
it man or beast?</p>

<p>Breathlessly I watched it, vague, inchoate,
scarce discernible; but the menace of its attitude,
the meaning of that slow advance, was unmistakable.
A man, undoubtedly, since in Poitou no
such bloodthirsty beast of prey existed. But who—who?
I glanced again at the sentry’s unconscious
face, so pure, so innocent. Should I warn
him? Should I——</p>

<p>The shadow stood suddenly erect, a knife flashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
in the air, and the sentry fell forward upon the
grass, coughing softly. The shadow bent over
the prostrate figure, the knife flashed again and
the coughing ceased.</p>

<p>Chilled with horror as I was, I nevertheless
realized that the moment for escape had arrived.
I slid from the seat and crept forward toward
the house, across that staring disk of moonlit lawn
where it seemed that the light of all the suns in
heaven was beating down upon me; then, with a
deep breath of thankfulness, into the shadow of
the shrubbery again. There I stood erect, and
softly but rapidly pressed forward. I gained the
walk. Before me was the open window—a
moment more——</p>

<p>Then I heard swift, soft steps behind me, and a
chill of terror ran up my spine and seemed to
stiffen the hair upon my head; for I knew that
the slayer of the sentry was pursuing me, knife
in hand—red, dripping knife in hand! Numb
with fear, I nerved myself for the struggle; but
even as I turned a powerful and cruel hand was
laid roughly on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Proceed, monsieur,” whispered a hoarse voice
in my ear. “Proceed. I will go with you.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I struck</span> the hand from my shoulder and
wheeled sharp around, ready for any violence.</p>

<p>“Go! monsieur,” he repeated. “Go! Do not
tarry here.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” I demanded, trying in vain to
see his face, which was only a dim blur in the
darkness.</p>

<p>“No matter. You do not know me. Hasten!”</p>

<p>“Then you shall not enter!” I said, and braced
myself for the attack I thought must follow.</p>

<p>“You are wasting time,” he growled, and
stamped with impatience. “On your head be it!”</p>

<p>“Why do you seek to enter?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I am a friend. I tell you I come to
warn M. le Comte——”</p>

<p>“You told me nothing of the sort,” I broke in.
“Again, who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Pasdeloup, and I swear that if
you do not stand aside I will give you a taste of
this knife.”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“The gatekeeper?” I asked; and I remembered
the glow of adoration which had lighted his countenance
as he gazed after his master.</p>

<p>“The same,” he said impatiently. “Will you
stand aside?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“No; I will precede you,” I retorted; and in a
moment more we were both inside the house.</p>

<p>As I turned to look at my companion I saw it
was indeed the stocky gatekeeper. Then my eyes
were drawn to his right hand, which clasped a
knife—a knife red with blood.</p>

<p>“So it was you struck down the sentry?” I
murmured, and shivered a little at the recollection.</p>

<p>“With this knife,” he answered, and returned
it to his belt. “If only the blow had killed them
all!”</p>

<p>I pulled myself together with an effort and
glanced about the room. It was empty. The
candles were guttering in their holders.</p>

<p>“Blow out the lights,” I said, “and bar the
windows. They may think we are retiring and
will wait till we have had time to get to bed. I
will warn M. le Comte.”</p>

<p>He nodded without replying, and as I sprang
across the vestibule and mounted the stair I saw
him going from candle to candle with incredible
rapidity. I had intended sending a servant to
assist him, but there was no sign of any in either
vestibule or corridor.</p>

<p>I sprang up the stair and found that the hall
above was also strangely empty. There was no
time for hesitation. Beneath the third door to
the left I perceived a ray of light. I strode to it
and knocked sharply.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” called a voice which thrilled
me.</p>

<p>“It is I, Tavernay, mademoiselle,” I answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
trying to speak calmly. “Dress yourself at
once——”</p>

<p>“I have not yet undressed,” she said, and threw
open the door. “What is wrong, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“The house is being surrounded by the Blues,”
I said rapidly. “But mademoiselle you must put
on a heavier gown than that and stouter shoes.
We may have to flee—to hide in the woods—and
the night is cold.”</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur,” she answered; and my
heart thrilled again at the calmness of her tone.
“I shall be ready in a moment.”</p>

<p>“When you have finished,” I said, “blow out
your light as though you were retiring. Then wait
for me here at your door with your maid——”</p>

<p>“My maid has disappeared,” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Disappeared?”</p>

<p>“At least I cannot find her. No one answers
the bell.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I assured her, though
my heart was heavy with foreboding. “The
smaller the party the greater our chance of escape.
Which is M. le Comte’s apartment?”</p>

<p>“At the end of the corridor.”</p>

<p>“I shall return at once,” I said, seized her hand,
kissed it and passed on.</p>

<p>M. le Comte opened his door instantly in answer
to my knock, and at the first glimpse of my face
stepped out into the corridor and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tavernay?” he asked. “What
has happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“The Blues have arrived,” I answered rapidly;
“they are posting sentries about the house. I
recognized Dubosq, their leader—the same fellow
who tried to trap you this morning. This time
he is making certain that you shall not escape.”</p>

<p>“Nor is that all,” said a low voice behind me.</p>

<p>I turned quickly. It was Pasdeloup.</p>

<p>“Pasdeloup!” cried his master. “What do
you here?”</p>

<p>“I come to warn M. le Comte.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“The <i>canaille</i> of Dange are on their way to
sack the château.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“It is to be turned over to them as soon as
M. le Comte and the women are taken prisoner,”
continued Pasdeloup without noticing the interruption.
“Nor is that all. They are to be permitted
to seize M. le Comte and to use him as the
mob of Paris has already used so many.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Pasdeloup!” repeated his master;
but his face had paled a little. “Where did you
hear such absurdities?”</p>

<p>For answer, Pasdeloup pointed along the empty
corridor.</p>

<p>“Where are your people, M. le Comte?” he
asked. “None here—none below—search the
whole house and you will find not one. An hour
ago they stole away along the road to Dange. I
alone could not be bribed or frightened into joining
them.”</p>

<p>His master stared at him for a moment, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
down the empty corridor, his face of a sudden
gray and haggard, as the truth was borne in upon
him.</p>

<p>“All?” he repeated hoarsely. “All? Even
Joseph? Even Marcelle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur,” said Pasdeloup, laughing
grimly. “Even Joseph. Even Marcelle. I do
not say that they wished to go. I only know that
they were afraid to stay. Where it is a question
of one’s life or another’s, one saves oneself. That
is human nature.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte stood yet a moment with bent
head, as though struck by a heavy blow.</p>

<p>“And you?” he asked at last, looking at
Pasdeloup.</p>

<p>Again Pasdeloup laughed grimly.</p>

<p>“It is my nature, too,” he said. “Only I am
not so easily frightened. Permit me to remind
you, M. le Comte,” he added, “that there is no
time to lose.”</p>

<p>His master controlled his emotion by a mighty
effort.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said. “We must get
away.”</p>

<p>“There is a break in the line of sentries,” I
suggested. “Perhaps we can get through;” but
my heart fell as I thought how nearly impossible
it was.</p>

<p>“At least we can try. Do you get Charlotte,
monsieur. I will bring madame.”</p>

<p>I sped along the corridor, pausing only an
instant at my room to snatch up sword and pistols<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and ammunition-pouch. Mlle. de Chambray was
awaiting me, wrapped to the chin in a dark cloak,
more beautiful than ever.</p>

<p>“I am ready, monsieur,” she murmured, her
eyes shining like twin stars.</p>

<p>“There is yet a chance,” I said. “Come;”
and I took her hand. “I love you!” I whispered
as we sped down the corridor together. “Whatever
happens to me to-night, remember—I love
you!”</p>

<p>She replied with a pressure of the fingers and a
little tremulous smile.</p>

<p>“I shall remember,” she said softly. “Is our
case, then, so very desperate?”</p>

<p>“It could not well be more so.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” she whispered, still more softly,
“tell me that you forgive me——”</p>

<p>From the garden came the shrill cry of an owl,
thrice repeated.</p>

<p>“Too late!” I groaned. “Too late!”</p>

<p>We were at M. le Comte’s door. Pasdeloup
was leaning against the wall, his arms folded, his
face very grim. My companion shrank back with
a little gasp of dismay at sight of him.</p>

<p>“He is a friend,” I said. “Where is M. le
Comte?”</p>

<p>As though in answer to the question, the door
opened and M. le Comte appeared on the threshold,
his wife at his side.</p>

<p>“We are too late!” I cried. “The signal has
been given—the sentries are closing in. A moment
more——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>A great crash echoed through the house, a sound
of breaking glass, a clamor of muskets beating
against door and shutter.</p>

<p>“To the tower!” cried M. le Comte. “This
way!”</p>

<p>We followed him around a turn in the corridor,
down a short flight of steps and along another
corridor so dark that, trembling at my temerity,
I passed my arm about my companion and pressed
her to me in order that she might not fall.</p>

<p>“We shall escape!” I whispered. “We shall
escape! God will not permit us to be killed like
this!”</p>

<p>I fancied that she drew closer to me, but I could
not see her face.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said M. le Comte. Then there
came the click of a latch, the creaking of rusty
hinges, and a gust of cold air rushed out upon us.
We pressed forward into the black pit beyond.
The door clanged shut behind us, and at the same
instant a shot rang out and I heard the pang of a
bullet as it struck the iron.</p>

<p>“Just a breath too late!” said M. le Comte with
a grim laugh and dropped the great bars into place.
“They will not soon get past this door,” he added,
as we stopped to take breath. “It is as solid as
the wall itself. We are safe for a time at least.”</p>

<p>“You are there, Charlotte?” asked madame’s
voice. “You are safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” answered my companion.
“M. de Tavernay has taken good care of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>She gently drew away from me, but left her
hand in mine.</p>

<p>“I hope you will leave her in my care, madame,”
I said. “It is a welcome trust.”</p>

<p>“So your spirits survive even this misfortune,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame,” I answered, “they would survive
much greater ones if—if only——”</p>

<p>“Well?” she prompted, “if?—continue, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“If only I might choose the persons with whom
to endure them,” I said boldly.</p>

<p>“You are right, Tavernay!” cried M. le Comte.
“So long as a man has beside him the woman he
loves he can face the world with a cheerful heart.
But come, let us ascend to the platform.”</p>

<p>We mounted after him, stumbling up the stairs,
one flight, two flights, three. To guide her steps
in the darkness I ventured again to slip my arm
about my companion’s waist.</p>

<p>“You heard?” I whispered. “You are not
angry that I permitted them to guess?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered softly, and with a strange
little laugh. “Perhaps they had already guessed.
Besides, I do not think I shall ever be angry with
you again, M. de Tavernay.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you love me!—you love me, then!” I
whispered, rapturously, and drew her still closer
to me.</p>

<p>“Not now, my friend!” she protested, tremulously.
“I beg of you, not now! Do not forget
your promise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“I shall not,” I assured her; and we mounted
in silence.</p>

<p>Only when we came out into the moonlight at
the top did she draw away from me and fling
herself into the arms of madame, who embraced
her tenderly and kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>The tower was battlemented, so that we could
look down upon the château and the grounds surrounding
it without danger of being seen by any
one below. As M. le Comte and I peered down
together I was suddenly conscious of some one
else beside me, and turned to see that it was
Pasdeloup. In the stress of flight I had quite
forgotten him. With a little feeling of remorse
I held out my hand and gripped his great rough
one silently, then turned again to a contemplation
of the scene below.</p>

<p>But down there all was dark and silent. Not a
candle gleamed from the windows; not a sound
disturbed the silence of the night. It seemed
almost that there had been no attack—that it was
all a dream—a fancy—that we had fled from
shadows.</p>

<p>“Can they have gone?” I asked. “Is it possible
that not finding us they have returned to
Dange?”</p>

<p>“You forget,” said M. le Comte, grimly, “that
single musket shot which almost reached one of
us. Depend upon it, they know that we are here.”</p>

<p>“For what are they waiting, then?”</p>

<p>“They are preparing a plan of attack no doubt.
They are trying to devise a way to get past that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
iron door down yonder. They know they have no
cause to hurry.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup suddenly held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he said.</p>

<p>For a moment I heard nothing—only the insect
noises of the night; then from afar off came a
sound as of bees swarming—a faint hum, vague,
threatening, incomprehensible. Louder it grew
and louder, swelling into a kind of roar, as though
a great flood were sweeping toward us down the
valley of the river. Then suddenly the roar burst
forth in overpowering volume; it grew strident,
articulate. Lights danced among the trees, and in
a moment more a shrieking, cursing mob poured
out upon the road, through the gates and over
the lawn.</p>

<p>“They have come,” said Pasdeloup, “the
<i>canaille</i> of Dange.”</p>

<p>And he folded his arms calmly as he stared
moodily down at them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="small">BREAD UPON THE WATERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Across</span> the lawn the mob poured like a foul and
hideous flood, reeling in a kind of drunken frenzy,
their voices mounting to demoniac screams now
that their goal was in sight—waving their blazing
brands above their heads, or shaking furiously
such rude weapons as they possessed. And as I
looked down at them I realized how thin and
fragile is the veneer of civilization, product though
it be of long and painful centuries. Here it had
vanished at a breath. These creatures had reverted
to the state of savages, and burned with
the lust of blood and plunder. They were wolves
indeed—and they were hunting in pack!</p>

<p>“Why, there are women among them!” I cried;
and indeed there were certain petticoated figures
shrieking as madly as the rest, though there was
nothing feminine in the frenzied countenances
revealed by the red light of the torches.</p>

<p>“The women are the worst of all,” said M. le
Comte. “They devise tortures of a fiendishness
beyond man’s ingenuity. They sit day after day
watching the guillotine. They are never sated
with blood.”</p>

<p>But the mob had reached the terrace, had swept
up over it like a tidal wave, and on into the house.
Instantly pandemonium broke loose—the crash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of breaking glass, of furniture riven asunder, of
doors burst from their hinges. It seemed that in
a breath the house itself must be destroyed, torn
stone from stone, under that fierce assault. I saw
madame shudder at thought of the havoc which
was being wrought among the objects that she
loved.</p>

<p>“But where are the Blues?” I asked. “Will
they stand by and permit this outrage?”</p>

<p>“How could they stay it?” asked M. le Comte
sadly. “They are powerless. They can do nothing.
As well hope to stay the tide of the ocean.”</p>

<p>“They wish to do nothing, monsieur,” said
Pasdeloup. “They abandon the château and all
it contains to the mob. See!—there they go
yonder.”</p>

<p>And following his gesture we saw two boats
loaded with armed men just slipping into the
shadows of the farther shore.</p>

<p>M. le Comte stared at them for a moment, then
down at the frenzied crowd on the terrace, and
grew white to the lips. At last he turned to his
wife.</p>

<p>“Come, madame,” he said, in a voice strangely
calm, “do you and Charlotte descend to the floor
below, where you can at least sit down. If I had
only thought to bring a candle!”</p>

<p>“I have one,” said Pasdeloup; and produced
from his pocket a piece of candle some six inches
in length, together with flint and steel. In a
moment the candle was alight.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried his master. “Now you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
feel almost at home, madame. Perhaps you may
even succeed in getting an hour’s sleep. Certainly
you will be far more comfortable than on
this exposed platform. Let me light the way.”</p>

<p>He took the candle from Pasdeloup’s hand and
started down the stair. Madame followed him
without a word, but her companion paused and
glanced at me. I was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she questioned, in a whisper.
“Why are we banished. There is no danger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, mademoiselle,” I assured her. “There
is not the slightest danger at present. I hope that
you will really get some sleep.”</p>

<p>“Sleep!” she echoed scornfully. “For what
do you take me?”</p>

<p>“For the loveliest woman in the world!” I
said. “In that, at least, I am not mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you have seen more of them!” she
retorted, with a flash of her old spirit, and started
down the stair. But at the second step she stopped
and turned back to me. “M. de Tavernay,” she
said, looking up at me with shining eyes, “you
must promise me one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“If there is any danger you will call me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said quietly, after a moment,
“I promise.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said; and waving her hand to
me, disappeared down the stair.</p>

<p>M. le Comte was back a moment later, the
shadow still dark across his face. He came directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to the spot where Pasdeloup and I stood leaning
against the wall.</p>

<p>“Now, Pasdeloup,” he said, “tell me what you
know of this affair. I confess that I do not in the
least understand it. And I want the worst—mind
you, the worst! I want to know the very uttermost
we shall have to face. Who was it set
these peasants on? Who set that trap for me
this morning? Whose hand is it aiming these
blows at me?”</p>

<p>For a moment Pasdeloup hesitated, staring from
his master down at the château and back again.</p>

<p>“You remember Goujon, monsieur?” he asked
at last; and it seemed to me that I had heard the
name, though I could not remember where.</p>

<p>“Goujon?” repeated M. le Comte. “No; who
is he?”</p>

<p>“One night three years ago, monsieur, as you
were about to retire, you fancied you heard a noise
in the room above your apartment—an empty
attic. You called a servant, and taking your
pistols, mounted to that attic. In one corner you
found a man crouching. You dragged him forth
and discovered him to be a creature who should
have been employed about the kennels. He excused
himself by saying that one of the maids
was his mistress; that, on leaving her, he had
lost his way and stumbled into that attic. The
maids did indeed sleep on that floor, and you
found that he was the lover of one of them. But
when she shrieked that it was not with her he
spent his nights, you did not heed her; you thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
it merely some excuse—some lie. So you contented
yourself with kicking the fellow down the
steps of the terrace and warning him never again
to set foot on your estate.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said M. le Comte, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, that fellow was Goujon, monsieur. Had
you passed your sword through him, all this would
never have occurred. Six months later you were
walking in your woods down yonder by the river
when you came suddenly upon a man setting a
snare. I chanced to pass at the moment, and we
brought him with us back to the château, though
he resisted desperately. Three hares were found
upon him——”</p>

<p>“I remember,” broke in his master. “Did I
punish him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur,” answered Pasdeloup quietly.
“You caused him to be stripped and beaten, then
branded on both shoulders with the fleur-de-lis.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the other with a sigh of relief, “I
am glad I was so lenient. I might have decreed
the gallows or the wheel for the miserable
poacher.”</p>

<p>“<i>Oui, dà</i>, monsieur,” agreed Pasdeloup, with
a grim smile; “but after all your leniency was a
mistake, for there are some men who prefer the
gallows to the white-hot iron. That miserable
poacher was one of them—although he has since
become Citizen Goujon, a deputy of the Republic.”</p>

<p>“A deputy?”</p>

<p>“He arrived at Dange a week ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“You mean it is he who aroused these
peasants?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. It was also he who sent
Laroche to you with the message that madame was
ill.”</p>

<p>Then in a flash I remembered where I had heard
the name.</p>

<p>“Pasdeloup is right!” I cried. “When Dubosq
was placing the sentries in the garden I heard
him say that it was from Citizen Goujon he had
his orders. But this Goujon cannot be such a
bad fellow, since he gave peremptory orders that
the women were not to be harmed.”</p>

<p>“Did he so?” asked M. le Comte with a quick
breath of relief. “Then it is only me he hates—it
is only me he seeks. Well, I can face death.
But when I saw that we were abandoned to this
mob I fancied—I fancied——”</p>

<p>“Do not fear, monsieur,” said Pasdeloup in a
strange voice. “This mob has leaders who will
also take care to deliver the women unharmed
into the hands of Citizen Goujon.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?” demanded his master.
“Why do you speak in that tone?”</p>

<p>“Because, monsieur,” answered Pasdeloup
grimly, “you do not know Goujon. Hatred of
monsieur was not the only reason which led to
this attack.”</p>

<p>“What other reason was there?”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup looked down at the mob, then away
to the east toward Dange, his lips compressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Come, tell me!” commanded his master.
“This is not the time for hesitancies.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup cleared his throat gruffly.</p>

<p>“Citizen Goujon has the audacity to love
Madame la Comtesse,” he said finally.</p>

<p>M. le Comte burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Any fool may worship a star,” he said. “He
cannot drag it down to him.”</p>

<p>“Goujon is trying to drag this one down, monsieur,”
added Pasdeloup quietly, “as he tried once
before. This time he believes that success is
certain.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte grew suddenly sober.</p>

<p>“‘As he tried once before?’” he repeated.
“Your meaning, Pasdeloup?”</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur,” answered Pasdeloup, with a
gesture indicating that the matter had been taken
out of his hands, “it was not by mistake that
Goujon entered that attic three years ago. That
girl to whom you would not listen—terror had
frightened her into the truth. For that attic extended
also above the apartment of madame. He
had fashioned a hole in the ceiling; he had even
planned to descend some night when you were
absent....”</p>

<p>“Ah, if I had known!” cried his master
hoarsely. “If I had known! But how do you
know all this, Pasdeloup?” he demanded, turning
upon the other fiercely, a sudden red suspicion
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Goujon himself told me,” replied Pasdeloup
calmly, “two nights ago at Dange, when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
drunk too much wine. Shall I continue the story,
monsieur, or have you heard enough?”</p>

<p>“Continue! Let us have it all;” and M. le
Comte bowed his head upon his breast.</p>

<p>“Expelled from the house and from your service,”
went on Pasdeloup, “Goujon spent his days
and nights watching the château in the hope that
chance might yet give madame into his hands.
He lived by poaching, as you happened to discover.
After you had punished him he still lingered
for a time in your woods, defying death.
He was half-mad, I think: he was willing to suffer
any torment, face any torture, if he could die with
the consciousness of having possessed madame.
Not only his passion for her, but his hatred of
you urged him on. At last he thought of a better
way; he joined the assassins at Paris, and now
he has returned armed with a power which will
give him his revenge. All of this,” he added, with
a gesture toward the hall below, “is for the purpose
of enabling him to taste that revenge. You
can guess now why he ordered that madame should
be delivered into his hands unharmed.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte’s face was livid.</p>

<p>“Is he in this mob?” he asked hoarsely.
“Point him out to me, Pasdeloup!”</p>

<p>“I do not think he is here,” answered Pasdeloup.
“Not yet—but he will come—and perhaps,
who knows, fate may give you a chance at
him.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte grew suddenly silent, searching the
other’s face with eyes intent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“How came you to be with Goujon two nights
ago?” he questioned. “Have you been consorting
with these scoundrels?”</p>

<p>“If I have, M. le Comte,” answered Pasdeloup
simply, “it was that I might better serve my
master—that I might pay my debt.”</p>

<p>“Your debt?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is another thing he does not remember,”
said Pasdeloup, turning to me with a sad
little smile. “But he was only a boy at the time
and it was to him a little thing not worth remembering.
We lived in a hut on the edge of the
wood yonder, my mother and I. Every morning
my mother cleaned the sties here at the château
and gave the pigs their food. For this she received
every day a loaf of black bread, and she
managed now and then to snatch a few morsels
from the trough when no one was near. For the
rest, we lived on the roots and nuts we gathered in
the forest, and we were permitted also to use such
wood as the storms swept from the trees. In this
manner we somehow managed to keep alive.</p>

<p>“But one day my mother fell ill. She could
not go to her work; instead, she grew worse and
worse, and I had no food to give her. In the
course of three days I myself grew so hungry that
I could think of nothing better to do than to sit in
the sun at the door of our hut and weep. It was
while I was doing this that I heard a noise, and
looking up, saw approaching me a horse ridden by
a being who seemed to me a god. He stopped his
horse and asked me what the matter was. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
overwhelmed was I by this vision that I could only
point to the door of the hut and to my belly. He
dismounted, he entered the hut, he looked at my
mother; then he came out, patted me on the head
and rode away. I was so dazzled by the sight of
him that for a time I forgot my hunger; but at
last it pinched me again more sharply than before,
and I reflected that after all the visit of the god
had profited me nothing. And I was just about
to renew my wailing when again I heard a noise,
and again saw my visitor approaching through the
trees. This time he bore in one hand an iron
kettle which he thrust upon me and bade me carry
in to my mother. The kettle contained two fowls,
steaming hot in their own juices,—the first I had
ever tasted.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now I remember,” said M. le Comte smiling.
“I snatched that kettle from the cook just
as he had taken it from the fire. I can even yet
see his astonished countenance. Well, did it save
your mother?”</p>

<p>“No, M. le Comte, she was too far gone for
that; but at least she entered heaven with a full
belly. She filled herself, slept and never awakened.
But it saved me, monsieur, and it is that debt
which I hope to repay.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said his master, looking at him, “if
I remember rightly, that boy must have been at
least three years younger than myself; while you
are at least ten years older.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how old I am, monsieur; I have
lost count of it; but I am that boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Then you cannot be more than twenty-seven.
Twenty-seven!” and he gazed at the squat figure,
the gnarled hands, the seamed and rugged countenance.</p>

<p>“No,” said Pasdeloup, “I do not think I am
more than twenty-seven; but for many of those
years, M. le Comte, I struggled day by day to
keep the soul in the body. That ages one, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed his master, sadly, “I see.”</p>

<p>“At first I was only in the way,” said Pasdeloup.
“No one wanted me, and I received
everybody’s kicks and blows. Then I grew big
enough to help with the pigs. Since I have been
keeper of the gate for M. le Comte,” he added
eagerly, “I have had an easy life.”</p>

<p>“Yet I have found you there whenever I passed,
day or night.”</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur has remarked that?” cried
Pasdeloup, his face glowing with pleasure.
“There is a corner between the gate and the wall,”
he explained, “where one is sheltered from the
weather. And I have learned to sleep with one
eye open, watching for monsieur. It is a thing
soon learned. And I sleep none the less soundly.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said his master, gently,
and stared for a moment gloomily down at the
crowd upon the lawn. “This Revolution is not
so surprising after all,” he added, half to himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="small">AT THE BELLE IMAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the scene below soon drew M. le Comte
from his abstraction; for even in the few minutes
we had spent in listening to Pasdeloup’s story,
told with a rude and simple eloquence which I
have tried in vain to reproduce, it had assumed
a new and more threatening aspect. The flood
which had swept into the château was pouring out
of it again, bearing upon its crest furniture,
draperies, railings, doors—everything, in a word,
which could be wrenched from the building. All
of this was thrown into a great pile in the middle
of the lawn and a torch applied to it. Then as
the flames leaped upward the marauders joined
hands around it and started a wild dance.</p>

<p>They had appropriated all the clothing they had
found in the château, and it was not without a
certain pang that I recognized one of my own
coats in which I had taken especial pride making
the circuit of the fire upon the back of a sturdy
rascal, utterly incapable of appreciating its beauties,
and wholly careless of preserving them. The
effect under other circumstances would have been
ludicrous enough; and indeed I found myself
smiling after a moment, so trivial did the loss
of my wardrobe appear in comparison with the
dangers which threatened us. A few hours before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
it had seemed a great disaster; now it scarcely
merited a second thought. For it was no longer
a question of whether I should enter Poitiers in
becoming state, but whether I should live to enter
it at all. Besides, for some hours I had ceased to
care as to the effect my appearance would have
on either M. de Benseval or his daughter.</p>

<p>“Those roisterers seem harmless enough,” said
M. le Comte after a moment. “It was foolish
to run away. If I had stayed to broach a cask
of wine for them they would have drunk my health
and marched away shouting ‘God and the King!’
with the best of us. They are Revolutionists
merely for the excitement of it, not because they
bear me ill-will.”</p>

<p>“Those around the fire perhaps,” assented Pasdeloup,
“but not those others;” and he indicated
with his finger a small group which stood motionless
in the shadow of the tower almost directly
beneath us. We leaned over the parapet and
looked down at them. The rays of the fire
glinted on knives, muskets, pistols. They were
fully armed, though they wore no uniform.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked M. le Comte.</p>

<p>“Goujon brought them from Paris with him,
monsieur. Look again and you will see their red
caps. They are heroes of the September massacres.”</p>

<p>I shivered at the words.</p>

<p>“Goujon wished to have at hand some one upon
whom he could rely,” Pasdeloup added quietly.
“He promised them that he would have agreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
work for them, and that they should be well
repaid, or they would never have consented to
leave Paris.”</p>

<p>“What are they doing down yonder?”</p>

<p>“They are watching the door to the tower.”</p>

<p>“Well, let them watch it. We shall not open
it, and they can never break it down.”</p>

<p>“I would not be too certain of that, monsieur,”
said Pasdeloup, gloomily. “They have learned
many things at Paris. Goujon boasted that even
unarmed the people had taken a great prison called
the Bastille—but most probably he was lying.”</p>

<p>“No,” said his master in a low tone, “in that
particular, at least, he spoke the truth. But
miracles do not repeat themselves.”</p>

<p>“They no doubt have other means at command,”
responded Pasdeloup grimly, “without
calling in the aid of the good God.”</p>

<p>“No doubt they have,” agreed his master; “but
at least we can reduce the number of these assassins;”
and he drew his pistols.</p>

<p>But Pasdeloup laid a warning hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>“Not yet, monsieur,” he said. “I may be
mistaken. Perhaps there is yet a chance. Perhaps
those others will refuse to join them. Perhaps
they will grow weary after a time and depart
for home, content with such plunder as they can
carry away. But if we begin the attack they
will be on fire in a moment.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” agreed M. le Comte, and
slowly returned his pistols to his belt. “Let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
wait, then. Meanwhile Pasdeloup, do you tell
us how you came to know so well what Goujon
was planning—and more especially why, since
you did know it, you did not give me warning.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, monsieur,” he said at last,
“and you will see that I am not to blame—that
I did what I could. You perhaps know the inn
of the Belle Image at Dange?”</p>

<p>“I have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“I was there one evening a week ago drinking
a glass of wine during an hour Laroche had taken
my place at the gate. It was the first time he
had ever proposed such a thing, but that night he
came to me and told me of the wonderful new
wine at the Belle Image, so good and so cheap,
since it no longer had to pay tithes, to the church
and to the aristocrats. He ended by saying that
as he was idle for an hour he would take my place
at the gate while I went to the Belle Image and
tasted the wine. I confess I was surprised; he
saw it and explained that he wanted me to test
for myself one of the benefits the Republic had
conferred upon the people. So I went. I saw
afterward that that was not his purpose at all.”</p>

<p>“I can guess what his purpose was,” said M. le
Comte; “but continue your story.”</p>

<p>“I was, as I have said, drinking my wine,” continued
Pasdeloup, “which was truly of a surprising
excellence, when a man came and sat down beside
me. For a moment I did not know him; then I
saw it was Goujon. He greeted me with a kindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
which surprised me when I remembered that
it was I who had helped to capture him; but he
seemed to have forgotten that. I saw that he was
well dressed and that his hands were white. He
ordered a bottle of wine even superior to that
which I was drinking, invited me to join him,
and began to tell me of the wonderful events which
were happening in Paris—events which would end
by making us all free, and rich, and happy. He
said that the aristocrats and the priests had been
starving and robbing and killing us for five hundred
years, and that now it was our turn.</p>

<p>“‘You remember that your own mother was
starved to death, Pasdeloup,’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I remember that.’</p>

<p>“‘Although enough to feed a hundred people
was wasted every day at the château.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I agreed, ‘perhaps that is true.’</p>

<p>“‘You know how she would have been beaten
had it been known that she stole even a morsel of
food from the pigs.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said again; ‘I know that.’</p>

<p>“‘You may perhaps remember,’ he went on,
with a frightful contortion of the countenance,
‘the punishment I suffered for trapping a hare.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I remember.’</p>

<p>“‘And do you think it just, good God!’ he
cried, ‘that a man should suffer like that for a
fault so trivial? Yet that is what was happening
day by day all over this broad land of France!
What could we do? They took our grain for their
bread, our flocks for their meat, our daughters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
for their pleasure. Did we so much as protest
we were hanged on the nearest gallows as a warning
to others not to lift their heads. We might
live or die, starve or rot—what did it matter! We
were less to them, as you have seen, than the swine
in their pens!’ I do not know,” added Pasdeloup,
in another tone, “whether all of this was true,
but it had a certain air of truth about it.”</p>

<p>“Most of it was true, I fear,” said M. le Comte
in a low voice, “though I had never looked at it
in quite that way.”</p>

<p>“There is a great difference, is there not, monsieur,”
asked Pasdeloup, “in whether one looks
at a thing from above or from below?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed his master still more quietly,
“there is.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” continued Pasdeloup, “Goujon
grew more and more excited with each word he
uttered. ‘Why is it,’ he demanded, ‘that some
people wear lace and jewels and others only rags?
Why should a noble’s pigs be treated better than
his peasants? Why should the peasants toil from
year to year in order that the priests and the aristocrats
may live in idleness with their women, and
have fine wines to drink, and fine clothes to wear,
and great houses to shelter them, while we who
make the wine, and spin the cloth, and build the
houses, have only swill and rags and hovels? Why
should they be warm in winter and we cold? Why
should we permit their game to destroy our crops
without being permitted to raise a hand to prevent
it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“‘I do not know,’ I answered, ‘except that it
was always so.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, it will be so no longer!’ he cried.
‘We are going to change all that. We are going
to reverse things. Monsieur Veto has already
sneezed in the sack; the Austrian woman and
her whelp will follow him.’</p>

<p>“‘And what then?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Then we shall be free. Then we shall set
about the work of establishing liberty, equality,
fraternity. But first we will stuff the nobles’
mouths with dust, just as those good fellows at
Paris stuffed old Foulon’s with hay. Come, you
must join us, Pasdeloup. You also have wrongs
to avenge.’</p>

<p>“‘I will think of it,’ I said, and returned to
my post at the gate.</p>

<p>“All that night I lay and thought of what
Goujon had said, and I confess, M. le Comte,
that it appeared to me reasonable. So long as I
had imagined that things were as they were
because the good God so willed it, I had not
questioned them. But now I began to suspect
that perhaps the good God had no hand in them at
all, and that the only thing left for us was to do
what we could to help ourselves. The next night
I inquired for Laroche, but no one had seen him;
so leaving the gate open—the first time that I
had ever done so—I hastened to the Belle Image.
Goujon was awaiting me; again he bought wine,
and again he laid before me the wrongs of the
peasantry. At last I told him that I would join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the society which he was organizing at Dange.
It was not until I had taken the oath that I discovered
what it was he intended to do. He
thought me wholly his, and indeed, from night to
night, he convinced me more and more that justice
was on our side.</p>

<p>“Two nights ago he was for some reason very
jubilant and drank more than usual. It was at
that time that he confided to me his passion for
madame; that he told me what it was he had been
doing in that attic at the moment you discovered
him. Then he passed on to the plan he had in
mind.</p>

<p>“‘We have all the servants now, Pasdeloup,’ he
said; ‘even the women. Those we could not persuade
we bribed; those we could not bribe we
frightened into joining us. The plans are made,
everything is ready. Your part will be to open the
gates for us.’</p>

<p>“‘Which gates?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘The gates of the château, of course.’</p>

<p>“‘Of the château?’</p>

<p>“‘Certainly, it is of the château I am speaking.
We are going to attack it.’</p>

<p>“‘But M. le Comte is not there,’ I protested.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said Goujon with a triumphant smile,
‘nor will he ever again be there. I have attended
to that. Laroche has lured him into our hands.
First I will bring him here in order that he may
witness my revenge—my triumph; then I will
send him on to Paris to celebrate his nuptials with
Madame Guillotine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Then I saw the trap into which I had thrust
my foot. As he sat there leering at me I was
tempted to bury my knife in his belly; but I
managed to control myself. It might be that
there were other things which I should know.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ I said, ‘since you already have
him why attack the château?’</p>

<p>“The leer on his face grew broader.</p>

<p>“‘You forget, Pasdeloup,’ he said, ‘that the
women are there.’</p>

<p>“‘What then?’</p>

<p>“‘What then? head of a pig! You are stupid
to-night! Do you suppose I have forgotten?
You do not know the sleepless nights I have
spent tossing on my bed, biting my pillow at
thought of what should one day be mine! Well,
my day has come—that woman is going to be
mine now—that is the triumph which Favras is to
witness. Will it not be a pretty revenge? Could
you think of anything prettier?’ and he leered at
me again and licked his lips with a tongue which
seemed strangely red and swollen. ‘You shall
have the other; she shall be your reward—and
<i>pardieu!</i> it is not to be laughed at. You do not
know, Pasdeloup, what soft, white skins these
<i>ci-devant</i> women have!’”</p>

<p>I felt my blood grow suddenly hot with rage
and a glance at M. le Comte’s white face told
me the agony he was suffering at the thought that
his wife had been profaned by even the glances of
this scoundrel.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said hoarsely. “And then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Perhaps something in my face betrayed me,”
Pasdeloup continued. “At any rate, Goujon
suddenly looked at me, then straightened back in
his chair.</p>

<p>“‘I have been talking nonsense, Pasdeloup,’
he said. ‘I have taken too much wine. I am
always saying absurd things when I am drunk.
You must forget that foolishness.’</p>

<p>“He said it so naturally that I believed him,
more especially since at the moment his head was
wobbling so that he could scarcely keep it off the
table. But when I reached the château again I
found that my zeal for the Revolution had vanished,
since, even drunk, one of its leaders could
propose such horrible things. Last night I remained
at my post at the gate; but to-night an
uneasiness seized me. I fancied that I detected
some sort of understanding among the other
servants. At the first moment I slipped away to
Dange to learn the truth. There I found that a
detachment of the Blues had just come in by
post and had been ordered forward at once to
surround the château. All of that rabble yonder
had gathered in the square and Goujon was
addressing them. The terrible things he was saying
made me tremble. But I listened only for a
moment. Then I hastened back to give you warning
and found that I was already too late. That
is all, M. le Comte.”</p>

<p>His master laid a friendly hand upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I thank thee, Pasdeloup,” he said. “Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the event, thou hast done thy best. Thou
hast paid thy debt a hundred fold.”</p>

<p>A sudden frenzied outburst of yells interrupted
him. We looked down again and saw a procession
emerging from the house upon the terrace.
Before them they were rolling five or six casks
of wine and spirits.</p>

<p>“We shall see now,” said Pasdeloup grimly,
“how many of them will shout, ‘God and the
King!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="small">MADNESS BECOMES FRENZY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a moment the casks were broached, and the
liquor, in whatever receptacles were at hand, was
passed around from mouth to eager mouth. No
one made the slightest attempt to husband it, and
it was soon pouring down over the steps in little
purple rivulets. The faces of the crowd, as the
flaring torches and dancing flames revealed them,
became more and more inhuman, their shouts
hoarser and more menacing, their actions more
and more bestial, until I felt my cheeks grow
hot at the thought that these creatures belonged
to humankind. Truly long centuries in the darkness
had rendered them unfit for the light! If
vermin such as this was to govern France, then
France would better far be sunk in the ocean!</p>

<p>Drunken couples reeled hither and thither
shouting incoherently; women forgetting their
sex pursued such men as made a pretense of
escaping and dragged them down into the shadows;
a half-naked girl mounted astride a cask
shouted obscenities at six or eight scoundrels who
were going through the pretense of a mass.</p>

<p>“The Goddess of Reason!” said M. le Comte,
his eyes dwelling upon this group; and indeed at
that moment, as the wretch who played the priest
made as though he were elevating the host, those
behind him burst forth in a hoarse shout:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Long live Reason! Long live Reason!”</p>

<p>Sick with disgust I glanced at the heavens,
wondering that God did not blast them with his
thunderbolts.</p>

<p>“I never thought such vileness could exist,”
I murmured; and Pasdeloup, who heard the words,
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Do not blame them too bitterly, monsieur,”
he said. “How does it happen that they are what
they are? What have they to thank God for?
Why should they be grateful to the church? All
their lives they have known only cruelty and
injustice. Now it is their turn.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” I agreed; and suddenly I
realized that this rude and ignorant peasant had a
broader and truer outlook upon life than I. And
I think that that moment saw the birth in me of
a new tolerance and sympathy. At least I hope
it did!</p>

<p>No thunderbolt came. Perhaps God, too, was
looking down more in pity than in anger.</p>

<p>Attracted by the shout others of the crowd
joined the group before the steps, drank of the
wine which the girl passed down to them, and
began a crazed Bacchanal dance before her. Then
a red-faced rogue dashed up the steps to her and
screaming with laughter tore her few remaining
clothes from her back.</p>

<p>“Long live Reason!” he shouted. “I baptise
thee!” and he dashed a cup of wine over her
glistening skin.</p>

<p>Another snatched a twig from a flowering shrub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and bending it into the semblance of a wreath
placed it upon her head.</p>

<p>“Long live Reason!” he shouted in his turn.
But a woman in the crowd, jealous perhaps of
the attentions shown the naked hussy, suddenly
caught up a clod of earth and dashed it into her
face; whereupon the goddess dismounted from
her throne, vomiting forth I know not what vileness,
was caught up by the crowd and passed
from sight.</p>

<p>Then one of their number mounted the steps
and began to harangue them. I could catch only
a word here and there, yet it was easy enough to
guess, from the frantic shouts which interrupted
him, what his subject was. The mob was in a
mood for any atrocity. It needed only the application
of the spark.</p>

<p>M. le Comte’s face grew grave as he gazed down
at them.</p>

<p>“That is serious!” he said. “When they
begin to speechify it is time to think of escape.
Have you anything to suggest, Tavernay?”</p>

<p>“If we could reach the ground on the side of
the tower away from the mob,” I said, “we
might escape into the wood, since there seems to
be no watch of any kind, nor any one to intercept
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but to reach the ground—we need a
rope.”</p>

<p>“Is there none in the tower? Surely we can
find something——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“At least, we can look,” he said, and led the
way to the stair.</p>

<p>I followed him, but Pasdeloup, his arms folded,
his head sunk in reverie, kept his place at the
battlement, staring moodily down at the drunken
revel.</p>

<p>We descended to the floor below where Pasdeloup’s
candle was still burning. A glance at
it showed me that it had been half consumed.
An hour more and we should be in darkness—if
indeed we had not entered the eternal darkness
long ere that!</p>

<p>In the first moment I thought the room was
empty; then I saw madame half-sitting, half-lying
on a couch in one corner, holding the younger
woman in her arms. As we approached she
raised a warning finger to her lips, and I saw
with a sudden burst of tenderness that Charlotte
had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>“Do not disturb her,” warned madame in a
low voice; but at that instant the sleeper opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment she stared up at us blankly; then
her eyes met mine and a wave of crimson swept
from brow to chin.</p>

<p>“I have been asleep,” she said, sitting hastily
erect. “In spite of all my boasting,” she added,
smiling up at me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said M. le Comte; “and you should be
proud of your steady nerves and clear conscience,
my dear. Not many of us are able to sleep so
peacefully in the face of danger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Danger?” she repeated, and looked about her.
“Has it come, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not a pressing danger,” he assured her.
“Still, we must devise some means of escape
before it becomes so. We shall have to take the
light, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said madame promptly. “Charlotte
and I will ascend to the platform.”</p>

<p>“It is not a pleasant sight that you will see,”
said M. le Comte, “nor pleasant words that you
will hear——”</p>

<p>“We are not children,” broke in madame.
“Come, Charlotte.”</p>

<p>M. le Comte lighted them up the stair and then
turned back to me.</p>

<p>“It is evident there is no rope here,” he said,
holding the candle above his head and looking
about the apartment. “The old furnishings hang
together better than one would think,” he added.</p>

<p>It was not until then—so occupied had my
mind been with other matters—that I perceived
with what sumptuousness the place was fitted up.
The tapestries were faded and dusty, the coverings
of the furniture moth-eaten and decayed, and the
room itself cobwebbed and moldy—but it was
impressive, nevertheless. It was of good size,
octagonal, conforming in shape to the tower, and
in four of the sides small, shuttered windows were
set. Tapestries and furniture alike had evidently
been of the most costly and elegant description.</p>

<p>“This was the boudoir of the fair Gabrielle,”
observed M. le Comte, looking about him with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
smile. “It has been years since I set foot here
and I had forgotten how it looked. You will see
that with my ancestor it was a real passion; he
did not spare himself. In fact I should hate to
confess how much, first and last, she cost his
family. Below is her bedchamber.”</p>

<p>We went down the stair into another room even
more luxuriously furnished. The great bed stood
at one side with curtains drawn. One almost
expected to see a small hand pluck them aside
and to hear a shrill voice demand the meaning of
our intrusion, or to be suddenly confronted by that
old gallant Favras, oath on lip and sword in hand.
Here there were no windows, only narrow slits
sufficient to admit air and light but not wide
enough to permit of assault from without. We
made a careful circuit of the apartment, but found
nothing which could by any possibility serve as a
rope.</p>

<p>“There is one more chance,” said M. le Comte,
and led the way to the bottom story.</p>

<p>This had been divided into two rooms, one a
sort of vestibule into which the outer door opened
and from which the stair ascended, and the other
a store-room. The vestibule was quite empty, and
the store-room contained nothing but a pile of
rotting casks and broken bottles.</p>

<p>My companion looked at them with a whimsical
countenance.</p>

<p>“The fair lady evidently did not lack refreshment,”
he said. “I would she had had the forethought
to leave us a few bottles. I am afraid,”
he added, turning back to the vestibule, “that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
only possible exit for us is through that door.
There are no windows in this story, nor in the one
above. To jump from the third story is to tempt
death—or at least a multitude of broken bones.
For myself, I prefer to face the enemy.”</p>

<p>“We might make a rope from the tapestries,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“They are rotten with mildew,” he objected;
and indeed when we tested them we found them
ready to fall to pieces at a touch. “Our situation
is not so desperate,” he continued, as we
climbed slowly up the stair again. “They will
have to starve us out, since they have no cannon
with which to batter down the wall, and that will
take two or three days at the least. Many things
may happen in that time.”</p>

<p>But though he spoke hopefully, I fancied his
voice did not ring quite true. When we reached
the platform he blew out the candle, placed it
carefully in a crevice of the wall, then went to his
wife where she stood leaning against the parapet,
put an arm about her and drew her to him.</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked, smiling up at him.</p>

<p>“We are not yet out of the woods,” he said;
“but, as I have just told Tavernay, there is no
pressing danger. They will have to besiege us
in form. Perhaps we may yet catch them
napping.”</p>

<p>I had approached Mlle. de Chambray, drawn
by an irresistible attraction—which indeed I made
no effort to resist.</p>

<p>“What is your opinion, M. de Tavernay?” she
asked, as I leaned against the wall beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“I confess,” I answered gloomily, “that I see
little hope of escape, unless we can sprout wings
and fly away. For you, mademoiselle, that would
not be so great a miracle; but I fear I am too far
below the angels to hope for such deliverance.”</p>

<p>“It is not the angels alone who have wings,”
she retorted, her face lighting with a smile. “I
have heard of other spirits similarly equipped.”</p>

<p>“It may be that I do not resemble them either,
mademoiselle,” I ventured mildly.</p>

<p>“Who can tell!” she retorted; and turned away
from me to gaze at the scene below.</p>

<p>The wine had done its work—had converted
harmless peasants and cowering wretches into
bloodthirsty brutes animated by a kind of frenzy
which we for a moment did not understand. Men
and women were running about screaming madly,
no longer heeding the fire which they had kindled
on the lawn, and which was now dying away for
lack of fuel. They were pouring in and out of
the house with some other end in view—and suddenly
we saw what it was.</p>

<p>For from one wing of the château came a puff
of smoke followed almost instantly by a quick
burst of flame.</p>

<p>“They have fired the house,” said M. le Comte
grimly; and we stood there numbly watching the
progress of the flames, as powerless to check them
as though we had been a hundred leagues away.</p>

<p>They ate their way through the building with a
rapidity which showed how artfully they were
being fed. Indeed it seemed to me that this whole
drama was moving forward to its climax with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
regularity which proved its prearrangement. It
was not a spontaneous outburst of the people; it
was a thing theatric, carefully thought out, in
which the actors were really only puppets controlled
by wires centring in one powerful hand.
And as I recalled Pasdeloup’s story there could
be no question in my mind as to whom that hand
belonged. I shivered a little as I asked myself
what the crisis was toward which the drama was
mounting. And I felt strangely impotent, as
though it were the very hand of Fate raised against
us, and not merely that of a vengeful and lecherous
scoundrel!</p>

<p>The flames burst out at last at roof and windows,
casting a red glow over lawn and garden,
where the mob stood staring in half-awed triumph
at its handiwork. Madame watched the destruction
with white face, but with an admirable
control.</p>

<p>“Can they fire the tower?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” answered her husband.
“Fire from without would have no effect upon
these solid walls, and they cannot get fire to the
inside. The breeze, you see, is carrying those
sparks away from us.”</p>

<p>“That was my home,” she murmured, “and I
loved it.”</p>

<p>“We will build another,” said M. le Comte,
pressing her to him. “When this cloud that covers
France has rolled away we will build another home,
which you will love even more, for we shall be
very happy there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Not happier than we have been here,” she
said, with a smile full at the same time of tears
and joy. “We have been very happy here, my
love. Whatever they do, they cannot take the past
away from us. The future belongs to God, but
the past is ours.”</p>

<p>I looked away from them with tear-dimmed
eyes down at that mob of savages. She had
spoken truly—after all, their power for evil was
limited to that: they could destroy the future, but
they could not touch the past. And I remembered
that I also had a past which was very sweet—a
past not long as men count time, spanning indeed
but a few short hours—and yet to memory an
eternity!</p>

<p>“What are those men about?” asked a voice at
my elbow, and Mlle. de Chambray pointed down
at a group which had drawn a little apart from
the rest.</p>

<p>They stood near the foot of the tower and
seemed to be staring up at us, though in the darkness
I could not be certain. Suddenly one of them
whirled about his head some object which burst
into a ring of flame. Then he hurled it up toward
us.</p>

<p>“The fools!” said M. le Comte, with a laugh,
“what can they hope to accomplish?”</p>

<p>As though in answer to the words there came
from beneath our feet a rending crash, a sharp
report, and a stream of acrid smoke poured up
the stairway from the room below.</p>

<span class="small">THE UNFOLDING OF THE DRAMA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Instinctively</span> I had caught my companion to
me to shield her from the shock, and we stood an
instant so with bated breath. Then a fierce chorus
of exulting yells startled us back to action.</p>

<p>“A grenade!” cried M. le Comte, and started
for the stair.</p>

<p>But Pasdeloup hurled himself before him down
the stair, through that choking cloud of smoke.
We were at his heels, and when we reached the
floor below I saw him tearing down the tinder-dry
tapestry, which was blazing fiercely. In a
moment we had stamped out the flames upon the
torn and splintered floor.</p>

<p>“They must not do that a second time,” said
M. le Comte when the danger was past. “I
thought the windows were shuttered.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup went quickly to the window through
which the bomb had come.</p>

<p>“This shutter is swinging loose,” he said, and
leaned coolly out to secure it.</p>

<p>A chorus of hoarse yells greeted him and a
spatter of musket shots. I heard the bullets clipping
the stones about him; but he heeded them
not at all and pulled the heavy shutter into place
and secured it with careful deliberation.</p>

<p>“We must look to the others,” he said calmly
when that was done, and himself made the circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
of the other windows to assure himself that the
shutters were in place.</p>

<p>“Bring down the candle, Tavernay,” said M.
le Comte. “We must see what damage has been
done here.”</p>

<p>Not until it blazed up from the spark which
Pasdeloup struck into it did I suspect that he was
injured. Then, as the flame burned clearly, I
perceived a smear of blood across his face.</p>

<p>“Not wounded, Pasdeloup?” cried M. le
Comte, whose eyes had been caught by the same
red stain.</p>

<p>“Only a scratch, monsieur,” Pasdeloup replied;
but his master was not satisfied until he had wiped
away the blood and assured himself that the
wound was indeed a slight one. A bullet had
grazed Pasdeloup’s forehead, cutting in the skin
a clean furrow which was bleeding copiously.
Pasdeloup submitted to this inspection with evident
impatience.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” he repeated. “It is nothing.
You are wasting time, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“All right, my friend,” said his master, releasing
him at last, “but I wanted to be quite sure;”
and he turned to an inspection of the room.</p>

<p>It was sadly wrecked, the furniture blown
asunder, the tapestries smoking on the splintered
floor; but the walls were intact, impregnable. M.
le Comte smiled as he looked at them.</p>

<p>“As well assault a lion with pebbles as this
tower with hand-grenades,” he said. “We are
safe as ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Except in one particular, monsieur,” broke in
Pasdeloup in a low voice. “They are now quite
certain that we have taken refuge here. Before,
perhaps, they only suspected it.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” agreed his master thoughtfully.
“Well, let us see what the next move will be;”
and he blew out the candle and mounted to the
platform. “Everything is safe,” he added, in
answer to madame’s look, and joined her at the
parapet.</p>

<p>As for me, I boldly took the place I coveted
beside the younger woman.</p>

<p>“It reminds one of Rome burning,” I said,
gazing down at the flames and the frenzied multitude.
“I might almost fancy myself a second Nero—you
perceive that the populace is cursing us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she retorted without raising her eyes,
“and no doubt, like Nero, you would fiddle in the
face of those curses.”</p>

<p>“There are moments,” I said, “when joy of
heart enables one to smile at any misfortune.”</p>

<p>“You are experiencing such a moment now?
You are fortunate!”</p>

<p>“I am, indeed. Perhaps Nero also had the
woman he loved beside him.”</p>

<p>“That would be an explanation, truly!”</p>

<p>“But one thing I am quite certain he did
not have,” I added in a lower tone, bending above
her. “He did not have, warm against his heart,
a flower which his love had kissed and thrown
to him.”</p>

<p>“We all of us have our foolish impulses,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
responded tartly; but I saw the glow which deepened
in her cheek.</p>

<p>“If that was a foolish impulse, mademoiselle,”
I said, “I trust it will not be the last one. But it
was not mere impulse—it came from your heart.
One day you are going to love me.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?” she questioned quietly.</p>

<p>I confess I had no answer ready; what answer
was it possible to give?</p>

<p>“I may add, M. de Tavernay,” she continued
more severely, “that I consider your jests exceedingly
ill-timed. Why talk of a future which will
never exist?”</p>

<p>“But it will exist!” I protested.</p>

<p>“Then no doubt you have already devised a
way of escape from this tower. It is only necessary
for us to depart whenever we are ready.”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I said; “I see no way
of escape at present; but I trust my star.”</p>

<p>“Your star?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it has never yet failed me. To-day—or
rather yesterday—after apparently plunging me
into the depths of an abyss it drew me forth and
led me straight to you.”</p>

<p>“And to this trap.”</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle; beside the other, that does
not matter!”</p>

<p>She turned from me with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“Your mind travels always in a circle.”</p>

<p>“Of which you are the centre, mademoiselle.
What other figure could my mind describe, revolving
as it does about you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“You have an answer always ready,” she retorted;
“nevertheless I think your star would have
done better by you had it permitted you to continue
your journey to Poitiers unmolested. You
would have arrived there with a free heart, ready
to fulfil your oath to your father; you would have
had no temptation to forget your honor; your life
would have been calm and happy.”</p>

<p>“The life of an ox would answer that description,”
I answered. “Yet I am very far from
envying the ox.”</p>

<p>“And there you are wrong. Besides, I have
still to add that as it stands you have no future
before you. You have come to the end of the
path.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I said, drawing nearer
to her. “Since there is no future, let us love each
other. Let us approach the end heart against
heart.”</p>

<p>She did not answer, only stared moodily down
over the parapet. The château was wholly given
over to the flames. They burst from every window;
they roared above the roof, and their scorching
breath caused us to shrink back a little.</p>

<p>“It is heart-breaking!” she cried, shielding her
face with her hand; and I saw that there were
tears in her eyes. “That beautiful home! Ah,
those wretches will be punished!”</p>

<p>“What would you do with them, mademoiselle?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“I would hang them every one. Men and
women alike. Men and women—beasts!”</p>

<p>And as I noted the sudden clenching of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
hands and flashing of her eyes, I could not but
wonder at the complexities of woman’s nature.</p>

<p>“Let us not look at them,” I said. “Let us
forget that they exist. Let us remember only
that we are here together and that there is no
future. Let us sit down here in the shadow of the
wall and imagine that we are again in the garden.”</p>

<p>“My imagination cannot touch such heroic
heights, M. de Tavernay. In the garden, I was
happy, or nearly so——”</p>

<p>“You confess it, then?” I broke in eagerly;
but she stopped me with a gesture.</p>

<p>“I have always been happy—at least until the
past few days. And in the garden I fancied that
even the little cloud which seemed to shadow me
would disappear. Now, on the contrary, I am
far from happy.”</p>

<p>“You are at least no coward,” I said. “You
are not afraid.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not afraid. It is the sense of helplessness
which weighs upon me and angers me.
I have always ordered my life to suit myself; I
have always had control of the circumstances
which concerned me. Yet here I am now, caught
like a rat in a trap. I can break my teeth against
the bars, and all in vain. I must wait for some
miracle to deliver me, and not only myself but my
dearest friends. Meanwhile their home, their
beautiful home, is burned before my eyes, and I
must look on helpless while a mob of drunken
brutes rejoices in its destruction. I know that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
miracle can restore it. And yet, M. de Tavernay,
you ask me to fancy myself in some fool’s
paradise!”</p>

<p>“It was a paradise,” I agreed; “whether a fool’s
or a wise man’s does not matter. Paradise is
always paradise.”</p>

<p>“Not for the onlookers!” she retorted.</p>

<p>“But what need those within care for those
without? Ah, I understand—you class yourself
as an onlooker. You have not love to work the
alchemy for you,” I added sadly.</p>

<p>She looked up at me slowly with luminous eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” she said. “I have
never been really within the pale. I have always
stood outside, peering in, wondering why others
thought it so beautiful.”</p>

<p>I know not what folly I was about to utter,
when a sudden tremendous crash sounded behind
me.</p>

<p>“The roof has fallen in,” said M. le Comte
quietly, as we rushed to the parapet. “That is
the end of it.”</p>

<p>The flames leaped high into the air with a roar
like the passing of a mighty wind over a great
forest. The mob seemed for the moment to have
forgotten us in the grandeur of that spectacle; but
always at the foot of the tower that little group
of armed men stood apart.</p>

<p>The sudden burst of light threw their faces
into strong relief, and Pasdeloup, who had been
staring down at them, uttered a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“He is there!” he said. “He is there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Who is there, Pasdeloup?” demanded his
master.</p>

<p>“Goujon! See!—that one with the cloak about
him—there at the right!”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash M. le Comte snatched out his
pistol, levelled it and fired. There was a cry of
pain from below and a man fell—but it was not
Goujon. M. le Comte put up his pistol with an
oath of anger and disappointment.</p>

<p>But hell itself had broken loose and such a
fusillade of bullets rained against the tower that
we were forced to retire from the parapet. All
the fury of the ages seemed whirled upon us; all
the blind madness which centuries of oppression
and injustice had engendered. Those of the mob
who were unarmed danced shrieking about the
tower, shaking their fists at it, or assailed the
great stones with their nails. It seemed that the
very uproar was enough to shake it from its
foundation.</p>

<p>“That was not wise,” said Pasdeloup gloomily.
“It was the one thing Goujon needed.”</p>

<p>“I know it!” confessed his master, and wiped
his forehead with a shaking hand. “Yet I would
have risked it gladly had I only killed that scoundrel.
I must kill him—I must kill him. I could
not rest in my grave with him alive!”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked madame. “Who is it that
you wish to kill?”</p>

<p>“The scoundrel who set these peasants on.”</p>

<p>“Who seeks your life?”</p>

<p>“Oh, more than my life, madame!” he answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
hoarsely. “More than my life! I could forgive
him that!”</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at him, not understanding.
Then her face went white with horror and
she put out a hand for support.</p>

<p>“It cannot come to that!” she murmured. “At
least we will not let it come to that!”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, and drew her to him. “Do not
fear, my love. It shall never come to that!”</p>

<p>The firing had slackened and at last we ventured
to look down again. The mob had drawn
away from the tower and had gathered into little
groups, staring up at it.</p>

<p>“It is to be a siege,” said M. le Comte, laughing
grimly. “If we were only provisioned we
might hold out indefinitely—and these rogues have
little patience.”</p>

<p>But Pasdeloup shook his head.</p>

<p>“You do not know them, monsieur,” he said.
“They have patience enough. But it is not a
siege they are planning—it is an assault—I am
sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, let them plan,” retorted his master.
“Let them assault. Much good will it do them!”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Pasdeloup quietly, “the
governor of the Bastille uttered the same words
when he looked down at the unarmed mob of
Paris from the battlement of his prison.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my friend,” agreed M. le
Comte gently. “He did not understand the
power of the people. But I, who have been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
La Vendée, should know better. You think we
are in danger, then?”</p>

<p>“Beyond question,” answered Pasdeloup.
“And I am glad that it is so—that there will be
no siege. Since there is no succor for us anywhere,
we must in the end either starve or surrender.
For myself I prefer a short, sharp fight,
with death at the end of it.”</p>

<p>“And I,” I said.</p>

<p>“For myself I can say the same,” agreed M.
le Comte. “But for the women!” and he glanced
toward where they stood, sheltered by the parapet.</p>

<p>“For the women,” said Pasdeloup grimly, “the
last bullets must be saved.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing, then, but to remain here
and be murdered?” demanded his master. “You
believe that, Pasdeloup?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, monsieur,” answered the
other cheerfully. “We shall first make every
effort to escape.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“I must consider it,” said Pasdeloup, with a
self-assurance which at another time would have
been amusing. “There is no time to be lost;”
and he disappeared down the stair leading to the
floor below.</p>

<p>My companion looked after him musingly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Tavernay,” he said, “I am beginning to
suspect that there are depths in these peasants of
which we never dreamed. I have seen them fight
like heroes, and I had always thought them
cowards. Here to-night I have seen one stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
erect, a man, and I had fancied that they could
only crawl. When France wins through this peril
and shakes off this madness which has her by the
throat, there will be such a searching of hearts as
the world has never seen!”</p>

<p>A sudden stillness had fallen upon the mob
below; no sound rose to the platform save the
crackling of the flames. We looked down to see
what this strange silence meant, and found that the
little groups of people had drawn still farther away
from the tower and were watching it with a kind
of awed expectancy. Their silence was infinitely
more sinister than their shouting. There was
something about it—something horrible and
threatening—which sent a chill to the marrow.
Why should they stand there staring at the tower?
What frightful thing was about to happen?</p>

<p>My companion evidently felt the same foreboding,
for he gazed down at them with drawn
brows.</p>

<p>“What do they mean?” he muttered. “What
do they mean?”</p>

<p>He stared a moment longer, then turned to his
wife.</p>

<p>“Come hither, my love,” he said, and when
she came, drew her to him and held her close.</p>

<p>My heart was full to bursting. In an instant
I was beside Charlotte.</p>

<p>“My love!” I said softly, and held out my arms
to her.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she whispered. “Oh, what is
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“I do not know. They are preparing something,
awaiting something. It is the end perhaps.”</p>

<p>“The end!” she echoed hoarsely. “The end!”
and she stared up into my eyes, her lips trembling.</p>

<p>“And if it were,” I questioned gently, “would
you not wish to meet it with my arms about you?
Oh, they are longing for you!”</p>

<p>She did not answer, but I fancied she swayed
toward me.</p>

<p>In an instant she was close against my heart—close
against my heart!</p>

<p>“Since this is the end,” I said softly, “since
there is no future, you are going to love me, are
you not, Charlotte? And there is a future! In
a moment more nothing can ever part us—your
soul and mine! Look at me, my love!”</p>

<p>The tears were streaming down her face as she
lifted it to mine.</p>

<p>“Kiss me!” she whispered. “Kiss me!”</p>

<p>I bent and kissed her and felt her warm lips
answer. Oh, now I could smile in the very face of
death!</p>

<p>“I love you!” I murmured, my pulses bounding
wildly. “I love you!—love you!—love you!
Now and always, I love you!—for life or
death!——”</p>

<p>A deep roar burst upon the night, a sheet of
livid flame leaped upward toward us, and the
tower swayed and trembled as though smitten by
some mighty hand.</p>

<span class="small">A BETTER MAN THAN I.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I opened</span> my eyes to find the tower still standing
and my love clinging to me, her face tear-stained
and white.</p>

<p>“We are safe!” she cried. “We are safe!
It was not the end!”</p>

<p>Then the bonds of bewilderment were struck
away, for the mob with a wild yell charged toward
the tower as one man.</p>

<p>“A mine!” cried M. le Comte. “A mine!”
And putting his wife gently from him, he hurled
himself toward the stair.</p>

<p>Blindly I bent and kissed the red lips still raised
to mine, put away the clinging hands—with what
aching of the heart may be imagined—and followed
M. le Comte without daring to look back.
Down we flew, half smothered by the fumes of
sulphur and clouds of dust—down into that black
pit which yawned to swallow us—one flight, two—then
M. le Comte held me back.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said—“wait;” and he descended
cautiously some few steps. He was back beside
me in a moment. “They have made a breach,”
he said. “I could see the glint of their torches
through it. But they must clear away the debris
before they can enter. We have perhaps five
minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“We can hold the stair.” I said. “It is steep
and narrow. Two swords can keep an army back.”</p>

<p>“But once they gain entrance below us they
can burn us out. No, we must escape, Tavernay—or
make a dash for it. Better death by the sword
than by fire.”</p>

<p>“And the women?”</p>

<p>“For them,” he said with set teeth, “the same
death as for us—it is the only way. For me, my
wife; for you, Charlotte. Are you brave enough
to thrust your sword into her heart, my friend?”</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out upon me, head to foot.</p>

<p>“God in heaven, no!” I cried, hoarsely. “Not
that—anything but that!”</p>

<p>“As for me,” said my companion, with a terrible
calmness, “I prefer to kill my wife rather
than abandon her to the mercies of Goujon. Come,
Tavernay, be a man! You love her and yet you
hesitate!”</p>

<p>“Love her! Oh, God!” I groaned.</p>

<p>“Come! We have but a moment. They are
almost through!” and indeed I could hear the
frantic blows with which the debris was being
swept aside, could see the reflection of the torches’
glare. By a supreme effort I controlled the trembling
which shook me.</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur,” I said, as calmly as I
could, “I am ready. What is it you propose?”</p>

<p>By the dim glare of the torches I could see his
white face poised like a phantom’s in the air
before me.</p>

<p>“Spoken like a man!” he said, and gripped my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
hand. “What I propose is this—we will hold
this stair until they find they cannot carry it by
assault; then, as they prepare their fire, we will
ascend to the platform, bid the women good-by—God
of Heaven!—what is that?”</p>

<p>I, too, heard the blood-curdling sound which
came suddenly from one corner of the room. It
was a sort of snarling whine, which rose and fell
and rose again, mixed with a hideous panting
which never stopped. There was something
bestial about it—something appalling, inhuman—yet
what beast could produce a sound like that?</p>

<p>Cautiously we approached the corner, sword in
hand. Whatever it was, however formidable, we
must have it out—we could run no risk of being
taken in the rear. The great, draped bed loomed
through the darkness, sinister and threatening.
The sounds came from within it. As I stared with
starting eyes I fancied I could see the curtains
quiver, as though the Thing behind them was
trembling with eagerness to spring upon us.</p>

<p>“A light! We must have a light!” cried M.
le Comte, stamping his feet in an agony of impatience.
“God’s blood! What is it, Tavernay?”</p>

<p>Gripping my teeth to restrain their chattering, I
advanced to the bed and jerked down the rotting
curtains. They fell in a suffocating shower of
dust; yet even then I could see nothing of what
lay behind. But the noise had ceased.</p>

<p>Then suddenly beside me rose a phantom, which,
even as I drew back my arm to strike, seized my
wrist and held it in a grip of steel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Not so fast, monsieur,” said a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“Pasdeloup!” I cried. “Pasdeloup! Was it
you, then?”</p>

<p>But Pasdeloup had already turned to his master.</p>

<p>“I have a rope, M. le Comte,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“A rope! A rope! But where did you get it,
Pasdeloup?”</p>

<p>“From the bed. Oh, I had trouble enough
loosening those knots! They had been tightened
by I know not what weight! The people who lay
in that bed were giants! And at the end I thought
it would be too late. But it is not—it is not!
Come—there is yet a chance!”</p>

<p>He started for the stair, and at the same instant
there came from below a crash of falling stone
and a chorus of exultant yells.</p>

<p>“They have broken through!” said M. le
Comte. “They will be upon us in a moment!
Tavernay, to you I confide my wife, and to you,
Pasdeloup! Hasten! Hasten! I will keep them
back;” and he took his station at the stair-head.</p>

<p>Without a word Pasdeloup threw the rope to
me, sprang to the corner where the bed stood,
and with a single jerk ripped off one of the heavy
posts, tipped with iron; then pushing his master
aside, roughly and yet tenderly, he seized for
himself the post of danger from which there
could be no retreat.</p>

<p>“Go, messieurs!” he cried. “Go quickly!
There is yet time!”</p>

<p>We stood uncertain. It seemed such a cowardly
thing to run away, leaving this man to face that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
frenzied mob—to abandon him, to permit him to
lay down his life for us—such a cowardly thing!</p>

<p>He glanced around to see us still standing there.</p>

<p>“Not gone!” he cried furiously. “Body of
God! Are we all to die, then—and the women,
too? Fools! Cowards!”</p>

<p>“He is right,” said M. le Comte hoarsely. “He
is right, Tavernay—it is cowardice holds us here!
We must go if we would save the women. Pasdeloup,”
he said, “I thank thee. I honor thee.
Thou art a better man than I!”</p>

<p>“Go, monsieur!—go!” urged Pasdeloup. “I
am paying my debt. My life has been yours any
time these twenty years. It is nothing. Go!”</p>

<p>Without a word, M. le Comte turned and started
up the stair. I followed him, my eyes blurred
with tears. And as we went we heard a rush of
feet behind us, then a chorus of groans and yells
which told us that the attack had begun and that
Pasdeloup stood firm.</p>

<p>And M. le Comte’s words were ringing in my
head.</p>

<p>Pasdeloup, Pasdeloup! A better man than I!
A better man than I!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="small">THE END OF GABRIELLE’S TOWER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> until we had reached the platform and
come out into the clear moonlight and the radiance
of the glow cast by the flames was it possible for
us to examine the rope and ascertain if Pasdeloup
had really provided us with a means of escape.
It was a cord, light, but of unusual strength, which
had been passed from side to side of the bed to
support the bedding, and was not rotted as I had
feared. But it was too short—a glance told me
that—too short by many feet to reach from the
parapet to the ground.</p>

<p>“We must use one of the windows,” I said;
and M. le Comte assented with a motion of the
head.</p>

<p>I ran down to the floor below, and closing my
ears as well as I could to the shrieks and curses of
the mob which was struggling to force a passage
of the stair, flung back the shutter of the window
which looked out upon the wood opposite the
château. Then cautiously I scanned the ground
about the tower, but could see no evidence of any
guard, nor any stragglers from the mob which
was hurling itself on Pasdeloup. With a deep
breath of relief I withdrew my head, and securing
one end of the cord to the great hinge of the
shutter, made a loop in the other.</p>

<p>At that instant M. le Comte came down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
stair bringing the women with him. He noted
my arrangements at a glance and approved them
with a nod.</p>

<p>“Now, my love,” he said; and madame came
forward at once, pale, but holding herself admirably
in hand.</p>

<p>By the moonlight which flooded the apartment
through the open window I perceived, dark against
her bosom, the handle of a dagger, and instantly
I knew who had given it to her, and why.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” she said, and lifted a radiant
face to his.</p>

<p>I knew that she believed she was going to her
death and was not afraid. They may rant about
equality as they will, but after all blood will tell.</p>

<p>“Good!” he cried. “You are setting us all an
example of courage. Sit here on the window-sill—so;
now swing your feet over—so; now place
them in this loop and grasp the rope tightly. Stay
close by the tower until we descend. It will be
but a moment. And now good-by, my love.”</p>

<p>She bent and kissed him, then let herself slide
slowly from the window-ledge while we braced
ourselves for the shock. I could see the shudder
which shook her as she whirled for a moment in
mid-air. I saw her teeth sink into her lip to
restrain the cry of terror which rose in her throat.
Then she succeeded in steadying herself, and we
lowered her hand over hand.</p>

<p>“God grant that she has not been seen!” murmured
M. le Comte; and from my heart I echoed
the prayer.</p>

<p>In a moment the rope slackened and we knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
that she had reached the ground. M. le Comte
leaned out and looked down at her and waved his
hand.</p>

<p>“She is safe,” he said. “She has not been
seen.”</p>

<p>In a breath we had drawn the rope up again.</p>

<p>“Now, Charlotte,” said M. le Comte; and I
helped her to mount the window.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said hoarsely, “take this
pistol. Conceal it somewhere in your gown; and
if you are surprised, if you see there is no escape,
use it.”</p>

<p>For an instant she did not understand; then
with a quick breath she held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said quietly. “I shall not
forget;” and she thrust the weapon beneath her
cloak.</p>

<p>“Good-by, my love!” I whispered; and with
melting eyes she pressed her lips to mine. “My
love! My love!”</p>

<p>She smiled at me tenderly; then she passed
slowly downward, out of sight. A moment more
and she, too, had reached the ground.</p>

<p>So concerned had we been in getting them
safely down that neither of us had thought or ear
for the tumult beneath our feet; but now, as we
paused an instant to take breath, it seemed to me
that it was mounting toward us.</p>

<p>“You next, M. le Comte,” I said; “and do not
wait for me. Get under cover of the wood, and I
will join you—but do not wait too long.”</p>

<p>He hesitated an instant, then sprang to the sill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“That is best,” he assented. “We shall wait
for you at the edge of the wood directly west of
the tower. You cannot miss us. And we will wait
until you come.”</p>

<p>He gripped my hand, caught the rope, and disappeared
from the window. At the same instant
I turned and darted down the stair.</p>

<p>At every step the pandemonium below grew in
volume until it seemed that all the fiends of hell
were fighting there. The pungent smell of powder
assailed my nostrils, and through the darkness I
caught the flash of musket and pistol and the
flare of torches. But with a gasp of relief I saw
that the mob had not yet gained a foothold in
the room.</p>

<p>I sprang to one side where an angle of the wall
shielded me from the bullets, and paused to look
about me. The air was thick with smoke; and not
until I drew quite near could I perceive Pasdeloup’s
squat figure. He was standing at the head of the
stair, a little to one side, his huge club raised in
his hands. At that instant a shaggy head appeared
and the club fell upon it, crushing it like a shell
of glass. The body pitched forward quivering, and
again Pasdeloup raised his club and waited, like
the very god of death.</p>

<p>As I silently took my place beside him I perceived
that the sounds from below were not all
yells of rage and triumph; there were groans
among them, and oaths, and screams of agony;
and as the smoke lifted for an instant I saw that
the stair was cumbered with bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>A sort of panic seized upon the mob as it discovered
its own losses, and for a moment it drew
back in terror before this mysterious and fearful
weapon, which slew, and slew—silent, untiring.
A sudden stillness fell upon them as they contemplated
that bloody stair—a stillness broken only
by those groans and curses. Then some one
shouted a sharp command, and a cloud of black
smoke puffed into our faces, and the odor of burning
straw.</p>

<p>As I touched him on the arm, Pasdeloup, whose
attention had been wholly concentrated on the
stair, wheeled upon me, his club ready to strike.</p>

<p>“Come!” I shouted in his ear. “Come!”
And I motioned to the stair behind us.</p>

<p>“M. le Comte,” he demanded, “where is he?”</p>

<p>“He is safe,” I answered. “So are the women.
Save yourself!”</p>

<p>He glanced at the thickening smoke and sniffed
the air with distended nostrils.</p>

<p>“They are going to burn us out,” he said; and
even as he spoke a tongue of yellow flame licked
the bottom of the stair.</p>

<p>Then the wounded wretches stretched upon it
understood the fate in store for them. Their
shrieks redoubled; but now there were prayers
mingled with the curses. My heart turned sick
within me as I looked at them.</p>

<p>“Come!” I urged, and plucked at my companion’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>This time he nodded, and I sprang up the stair.
He followed at my heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Here we are,” I said, and paused at the open
window.</p>

<p>He motioned me to precede him. I sprang to
the sill, seized the cord and slid to the ground so
rapidly that it burnt into my fingers; but I scarcely
felt the pain. In a moment Pasdeloup stood beside
me.</p>

<p>“This way,” he said; and without an instant’s
hesitation led the way toward a thicket near the
tower. We plunged into it without stopping to
look back and pushed our way forward until we
came to a little eminence bare of trees. Here we
paused to take breath.</p>

<p>The dawn was just tinging the eastern sky, but
across the cold, grey light there burst suddenly
a mighty finger of flame. It was the tower, blazing
like a monster torch; and I shuddered as I
thought of the fate of the wretches who had
perished there.</p>

<span class="small">THE TRAGEDY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pasdeloup</span> did not so much as glance at the
blazing tower. He was gazing at the woods about
us, scanning each thicket with eyes preternaturally
bright. It was still too dark for me to discern
anything in the smudge of shadow beneath the
trees, but my companion seemed to labor under
no such disability. I knew of course that he was
searching for some trace of his master.</p>

<p>“He said that he would wait for us at the edge
of the wood,” I told him, “straight westward
from the tower.”</p>

<p>“We came that way,” said Pasdeloup gruffly.
“It was there I thought to find him, but he was
not there. I will go back again. Wait here for
me.”</p>

<p>In an instant he had disappeared beneath the
trees so quietly that I did not hear so much as
the rustle of a leaf. He melted into the forest;
became a part of it.</p>

<p>I turned back to the tower and watched the
flames as they leaped high in the heavens, as
though striving to touch the stars, which faded
and paled before the growing light in the east.
Dawn was at hand, and I realized the folly of
lingering there. That rope hanging from the
window must be soon discovered—perhaps had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
been discovered long ere this—and pursuit of
course would follow instantly. And my heart
suddenly chilled at the thought that perhaps M.
le Comte and the women had walked straight into
a trap which had been set for them.</p>

<p>The thought brought me to my feet, and I
looked to right and left with an overpowering
feeling of helplessness. At the first step I would
be lost. And yet I could not stand idle——</p>

<p>A sudden vivid sense of companionship caused
me to start around. It was Pasdeloup who had
returned as noiselessly as he had gone.</p>

<p>“You found them?” I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head and sank to a sitting posture,
his brows knitted, his eyes staring straight before
him. I burned to ask the direction of his search,
the details of it, but something in his attitude
warned me to hold my tongue. Then suddenly his
face cleared and he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, and set off down the hill at a
pace which I found it hard to equal.</p>

<p>Once among the trees the going was still more
difficult, but Pasdeloup sped forward with astonishing
ease and swiftness and as silently as a
shadow. As for myself, I floundered through the
underbrush and over the uneven ground as best
I could. But the best was bad enough, and more
than once I fancied that Pasdeloup had abandoned
me to my own resources, as I certainly deserved.
But always I found him patiently awaiting me.
He seemed to have some well-defined objective
point in view, for he went straight forward without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
looking to right or left. We came out at the
end of half an hour into a gentle valley nearly
free of trees, and up this he turned almost at a
run. At last I panted after him up a little hill
and found him calmly sitting at the top.</p>

<p>I flung myself beside him, breathless, utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p>“Do not wait for me,” I said, as soon as I
could speak. “You must find them—they need
you more than I. I will shift for myself.”</p>

<p>“We stop here,” he answered, still gruffly.
“They must pass this way.”</p>

<p>At last I was able to sit up and look about me.
The hill on which we were stood at the junction
of two little valleys.</p>

<p>“They must come by one of those,” continued
Pasdeloup. “We will wait until they pass.”</p>

<p>“But why did they not wait for us in the
wood?” I questioned. “Perhaps M. le Comte
gave me up when I did not follow him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Pasdeloup. “They waited, but
they were discovered and forced to flee.”</p>

<p>“Discovered?” I repeated despairingly.</p>

<p>“At least a body of peasants passed over the
spot where they had stopped. Perhaps they were
not seen.”</p>

<p>I breathed again.</p>

<p>“And they will come this way?”</p>

<p>“They must, if they keep to the cover of the
woods.”</p>

<p>“They will, of course, do that,” I said, and
strained my eyes down each of the valleys in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Our position commanded a considerable view
of the surrounding country, but the château was
hidden by a low spur of hill which ran down into
the valley at our left. I fancied I could still see
in the sky the reflection of the light from the
burning tower, but a moment later I saw it was the
sun just peeping over the trees to the east.</p>

<p>Then I began to chafe at the delay, for it seemed
to me that we were wasting time. I glanced at
my companion and found that apparently he had
totally forgotten me.</p>

<p>“Pasdeloup,” I said at last, “are you quite sure
that M. le Comte must pass this hill?”</p>

<p>He looked up with a start and a frown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered harshly; and I saw that
he himself was disturbed by the delay. “To north
and south are only open fields where people are
working, and many houses. He could not hope to
pass that way unseen, especially with the women.
He will know this. He will know that he must
follow this valley to the west. In this way he can
keep to the shelter of the hills until he reaches
the valley of the Dive. Beyond that is the
Bocage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed; “it is the Bocage he will seek
to reach. But perhaps he has already passed.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup shook his head.</p>

<p>“Impossible. We came by a shorter way which
the women could not have followed. Besides, he
said he would wait for you. It is that which is
delaying him. He fancies you are lost somewhere
in the woods down yonder. I shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
seek him;” and he rose to his feet with sudden
resolution.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and stood for an instant staring
down the valley.</p>

<p>“It is they!” he cried. “It is they!”</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet and followed with my eyes
his pointing finger. For some moments I saw
nothing—only the tangle of trees and underbrush;
then I caught a movement among the trees and
three figures came out into the little glade below
us.</p>

<p>The women advanced slowly and with difficulty,
as though already weary. M. le Comte paused to
look back.</p>

<p>“You were right,” I said, touched to the heart.
“He is still seeking me.” But Pasdeloup had
placed his hand behind his ear and was listening
intently, his face of a sudden rigid as stone.</p>

<p>“They have waited for you too long,” he said
roughly. “They are followed;” and he plunged
down the hillside, I after him.</p>

<p>M. le Comte had given an arm to each of the
women and was hurrying them forward, encouraging
each in turn. Not until we were almost upon
them did he hear us; then he snatched out his
pistols and whirled toward us.</p>

<p>“M. le Comte!” I cried. “Madame!” But
my eyes were only for that other face, gray and
dreary in the cold light of the morning. She had
been staring listlessly at the ground, but at sound
of my voice she started round upon me, her face
white as death.</p>

<p>“Tavernay!” cried M. le Comte, a great light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
in his eyes. “And Pasdeloup! Ah, I understand
now why you lingered!” and he held out a hand
to each of us. “We thought you dead! We
thought the flames had caught you!”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Pasdeloup. “This is no time
for words.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” agreed his master. “Tavernay,
I again entrust Charlotte to you.”</p>

<p>I crossed to her, took her hands in mine and
drew her to me.</p>

<p>“I thought you dead,” she murmured, raising
brimming eyes to mine. “I thought you had
stayed too long;” and I felt how she was trembling.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Pasdeloup again; “there is a
hiding-place, if we can only reach it;” and he
glanced anxiously over his shoulder.</p>

<p>I drew my love forward, my arm still about her.</p>

<p>“We are going to escape,” I murmured in her
ear. “We are going to be very happy. God
intends it.”</p>

<p>She looked up into my eyes and smiled tremulously.
I could guess how near she was to absolute
exhaustion and did my best to shield her.
Our way for a time led over a smooth meadow,
then we plunged into the rocky bed of a brook
which mounted so steeply that our progress was
very slow. The way grew more and more rough,
great boulders blocked the path, and on either
side the banks of the torrent rose abruptly to a
height of many feet.</p>

<p>Then, from far down the valley behind us, came
the bay of a hound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>M. le Comte stopped and listened.</p>

<p>“I know that sound,” he said. “That is
Roland. What can he be hunting?”</p>

<p>“He is hunting his master,” answered Pasdeloup
grimly. “Goujon devised that trick.”</p>

<p>“Goujon!” murmured M. le Comte. “Always
Goujon.”</p>

<p>“It was he trained the dog,” added Pasdeloup.
“Come; we are losing time.”</p>

<p>“The women cannot go much farther along
such a road as this,” his master warned him.</p>

<p>“We have not far to go—just around that turn
yonder, and we are safe.”</p>

<p>Suddenly behind us rose a chorus of savage yells.</p>

<p>“They have seen us!” said M. le Comte.</p>

<p>I drew my companion to me and half carried
her up the steep slope over which in rainy weather
the torrent plunged. Pasdeloup had already
reached the top. As I looked back I saw a mob
of men clambering savagely over the rocks below.
At that instant M. le Comte panted up with
madame in his arms.</p>

<p>“There!” he said with a smile of triumph, as
he placed her on her feet. “That is accomplished!
For the moment we are safe. They will never
dare——”</p>

<p>A single musket shot rang out. I saw the smoke
drift slowly up, and at the same instant madame
staggered and fell into her husband’s outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he cried. “Oh, my love! My
love!”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AS I LOOKED BACK I SAW A MOB OF MEN CLAMBERING<br />
SAVAGELY OVER THE ROCKS BELOW</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Her eyes were open and she was gazing fondly
up at him. She tried to speak, but could not. Her
lips were flecked with blood. Then her eyes closed,
her arm fell limp.</p>

<p>It had happened so suddenly that I could not
realize it—could not believe it.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Pasdeloup again, and touched
his master’s arm.</p>

<p>M. le Comte lifted to us a face convulsed.</p>

<p>“Go!” he said hoarsely. “Pasdeloup, I
charge you with those two. Save them! I can
hold this mob back.”</p>

<p>Pasdeloup looked down at them. They were
very near and climbing steadily upward. With
a strength almost superhuman he caught up a huge
boulder and sent it bounding toward them down
the slope. They saw it coming and scattered; then,
when a second followed it, fled wildly. Their
advance had been checked for the moment.</p>

<p>Pasdeloup turned back to his master.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said again.</p>

<p>M. le Comte laid his wife’s body gently down
and stood erect.</p>

<p>“I tell you I die here,” he said, a great calmness
in his eyes. “Will you obey me, or will you
not? I command you to guide these two to the
hiding-place you spoke of.”</p>

<p>For an instant Pasdeloup’s eyes blazed defiance;
then he glanced down at the enemy, and his lips
curved into a smile. He bent his head and set
off up the stream.</p>

<p>“Follow him, Tavernay,” commanded M. le<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Comte, seeing that I hesitated. “I would not
save my life if I could—it is loathsome to me. I
commend Charlotte to you. Go straight west to
the Bocage; there you will find friends. God bless
you!”</p>

<p>“I cannot go,” I faltered. “I cannot leave you
here. That would be too cowardly!”</p>

<p>“Cowardly?” he echoed, facing around upon
me. “It is I who have chosen the coward’s part!
To you I give a duty far more difficult. Ah, here
they come!” he added, and raised his pistols.
“Go—I beg of you. Be brave enough to go.”</p>

<p>I could do nothing but obey—no other path lay
open. With sinking heart I passed my arm again
about the waist of my companion, who had seemingly
lapsed into a sort of stupor, and followed
Pasdeloup who was awaiting us impatiently at a
little distance.</p>

<p>“This way,” he said; and turned from the bed
of the torrent up the steep hillside. I paused for
one backward glance at the friend I had abandoned.
He was standing erect, pistols in hand.
The tears blinded me, and I hastened on.</p>

<p>In a moment Pasdeloup stopped.</p>

<p>“Do you see that ledge of rock up yonder overgrown
with vines?” he asked. “Put the vines
aside and you will find behind them a very comfortable
cavern. Enter it and you are safe.”</p>

<p>“And you?” I asked, seeing that he turned
away.</p>

<p>“I? Oh, I return to my master;” and he was
off in an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>I gazed after him, touched anew by that dog-like
devotion, until he disappeared from sight
down the bed of the torrent. In the distance I
heard a rattle of muskets. They were attacking
him, then; and I pictured to myself that gallant
figure defying them, his eyes gleaming, a smile
upon his lips. Ah, if I were only there beside him!</p>

<p>Then suddenly I became conscious of a dead
weight on my arm, and glanced down to see that
Charlotte was lying there unconscious.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="small">I TAKE A VOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant I was so shaken by that dead
weight on my arm, by that white drawn face
turned blindly up to mine, that my heart stopped
in my bosom; for I recalled that other white face
and that other limp form I had seen but a moment
since. Then I shook the horror off.</p>

<p>“She has only fainted,” I told myself. “She is
not dead; she cannot be dead; it is nothing; it
will pass in a moment;” and gripping my teeth
together in a very agony of effort I lifted her in
my arms and set off up the hillside toward the
ledge which Pasdeloup had pointed out. How
I reached it I know not, for ere I covered half the
distance the world was reeling red before me and
the blood pounding like a hammer in my brain.
But reach it I did, and pushing aside that curtain
of vines, I saw behind it the dark entrance to
the cavern, framed by the solid rock. I stooped
and entered, then laid my burden gently on the
hard, dry floor, and flung myself well-nigh senseless
beside her.</p>

<p>But a moment or two sufficed to give me back
my breath, and struggling to my feet I first
assured myself that the leafy curtain had fallen
naturally into place. Then I made a quick circuit
of the cavern. I found it rudely circular, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
diameter of perhaps a rod and a height of half
as much. Pasdeloup had doubtless occupied it
more than once, for in one corner was a pile of dry
moss, which had evidently served for a bed. To
this I bore that still, limp body and fell to
chafing wrist and temple, with a harrowing fear
again gripping my heart. She was so pale, so
haggard, her hands were so cold and nerveless,
that I was almost ready to believe that the horrors
and hardships of the night had slain her. There
was no pulse, no respiration....</p>

<p>Despairingly I let the limp hand fall. My path
lay clear before me—I would share the fate of
my companions—I would die beside them!</p>

<p>I bent and kissed her lips, softly, reverently.
And in that instant a gentle sigh came from them,
her eyes opened and she lay looking up at me.</p>

<p>“Then you are not dead!” I cried. “You are
not dead!” And I caught up her hands again
and chafed them madly, feeling with joy indescribable
the warmth of life returning to them.</p>

<p>She lay still a moment longer, then gently drew
her hands away and raised herself to a sitting
posture.</p>

<p>“Where are we?” she questioned, staring about
her in the green half-light which filtered through
the leafy curtain.</p>

<p>“We are in a cavern which Pasdeloup knew of,”
I explained. “We are safe.”</p>

<p>“I thought we were under the ocean,” she said,
still staring about her. “Far down in the depths
of the ocean—I have always fancied it must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
like this. But where are the others?” she demanded
suddenly.</p>

<p>“That I do not know,” I answered as cheerfully
as I could. “No doubt they have escaped in
another direction;” but in my heart I knew the
absurdity of such a hope.</p>

<p>“You left them, then?” she questioned, looking
at me from under level brows.</p>

<p>“M. le Comte commanded it,” I answered flushing.
“Do you not remember?”</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her temples.</p>

<p>“I remember nothing,” she said at last, “except
that we climbed a great mountain, and that your
arm was about me, aiding me.”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief that her memory
stopped there.</p>

<p>“Shall I go back and look for them?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she protested, and caught my hand.
“Do not leave me here—at least not yet!”</p>

<p>“I shall have to go before long. We must
have food.”</p>

<p>“I want no food—I feel as though I never
shall.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless you must eat. You must be
strong and brave. We have a long journey before
us.”</p>

<p>“A long journey?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we shall not be really safe until we are
among M. le Comte’s friends in the Bocage.”</p>

<p>“Is that far?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not so far but that we shall win through
safely,” I assured her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>She lay back again upon the moss with a long
sigh of utter weariness.</p>

<p>“You must sleep,” I added, gently. “Do not
fight it off—yield to it. You will need your
strength—all of it—for to-night.”</p>

<p>“For to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we dare not start until darkness comes,
and we must get forward as far as we can ere
daybreak. You can sleep in perfect security. No
one suspects that we are hidden here.”</p>

<p>She did not answer, but turned on one side, laid
her head upon her arm and closed her eyes. Sleep,
I knew, would claim her in a moment.</p>

<p>I crept forward to the mouth of the cavern and
sitting down behind the screen of vines pulled
them aside a little and peered down the valley, in
the hope that I might see Pasdeloup and M. le
Comte making their way toward us. But there
was no one in sight, nor could I hear any sound
of conflict in the direction whence we had come.
It might be, I told myself, that Pasdeloup by some
miracle had again succeeded in saving his master,
and that they had fled together in some other
direction; but I felt there were limits to the power
of even his supreme devotion. Certainly no situation
could have been more critical and hopeless
than that in which I had left my friend.</p>

<p>Whatever the result of that struggle, there was
evidently nothing left for me to do save to stand
sentinel over my companion and see that no harm
came to her. I sat down with my back against
the wall of stone and composed myself as comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
as I could to watch the valley. Indeed my
posture was too comfortable. The knowledge
that we were safe, the lifting of the cloud of
horror, the slackening of the strain under which
I had labored, left me strangely weary. My eyelids
drooped, and before I realized the danger I
was sound asleep.</p>

<p>I awoke with a guilty start, but a single glance
down into the valley reassured me—no danger
threatened us from that direction. How long I
had slept I could not guess, but it must have been
some hours, for I felt refreshed, invigorated, ready
for anything—ready especially to undertake an
energetic search for food to appease the gnawing
in my stomach.</p>

<p>But first I turned back into the cave and bent
over my companion. She was still sleeping peacefully.
A ray of light which had fought its way
through the leafy curtain fell upon her face in
benediction. I saw how sleep had wiped away the
lines of weariness and care, and I knew she would
be ready for the task which nightfall would bring
with it.</p>

<p>I drew her cloak more closely about her, then
went out softly, leaving her undisturbed. I
glanced up and down the valley to assure myself
that I was unobserved, drew carefully together the
veil of vines behind me, then paused a moment to
reflect. I had two things to do—I must secure
food, and I must discover if possible the fate of
our companions. I resolved to do the latter first,
and so proceeded cautiously down the valley, keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a sharp lookout on every side. I thought for
a time that I had got my directions strangely
reversed, for the sun appeared to be rising in the
west instead of in the east; but I soon perceived
that it was not rising at all, but setting, and that
instead of being mid-morning, it was mid-afternoon.
I had slept not three or four hours, as I had
fancied, but eight or nine.</p>

<p>That discovery had the effect of hastening my
steps and lessening my caution. I had no time to
lose, and whatever the result of the fight at the
cliff, it was improbable that any of the enemy had
lingered so long in the neighborhood. So I went
forward boldly and as swiftly as I could, down
the hill, into the narrow bed of the torrent where
now murmured the clear waters of a little brook,
over the rough stones, around a jagged point of
rock—and the scene of the fight lay before me.</p>

<p>For a moment I saw only the rocks, the red
earth. Then my eye was caught by a huddled
mass so trampled into the mud as to be almost
indistinguishable from it, yet unmistakably a
human body. I hastened to it; I bent above it and
stared down into the battered and blackened face.
Disfigured, repulsive as it was, I knew it instantly—it
was Pasdeloup.</p>

<p>With a sudden feeling of suffocation I stood
erect and looked about me, trembling at the
thought of the dread objects my eyes sought and
yet shrank from. Then I drew a quick breath of
relief, of joy, of thankfulness. Pasdeloup had
sacrificed his life, indeed, but not in vain. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
master had escaped—by some miracle he had
escaped, bearing his wife with him. But which
way had he gone? Why had he not pressed forward
to the cave? Which way——</p>

<p>I stopped, shivering, my eyes burning into my
brain; for there, in cruel exposure half way down
the slope, were two objects....</p>

<p>How I got down to them, shaken as I was by
the agony of that discovery, I know not. I remember
only the tempest of wild rage which burst
within me as I looked down at those mutilated
figures. And I held my clenched hands
above my head and swore, as there was a God in
heaven, that I would have vengeance on the devil
who had done this thing. He should pay for it—he
should pay to the uttermost, drop by drop. I
vowed myself to the task. By my father’s memory,
by my mother’s honor, by my hope of heaven, I
swore that for me there should be no rest, no
happiness, no contentment, until I had pulled this
monster down and sent his soul to the torture
which awaited it.</p>

<p>For an instant the mad thought seized me to
set off at once on the trail of the murderers, to
harry them, cleave them asunder, seize the fiend
who had set them on and wring his life out. A
superhuman strength possessed me, a divine ardor
of vengeance; and not for an instant did I doubt
that God would nerve my arm to accomplish all
this. But suddenly I remembered that another
duty had been laid upon me. I must discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
that first; I must go on to the Bocage. Then I
could turn back to Dange.</p>

<p>I grew calmer after a time; that divine rage
passed and left me weak and shaken. I sat limply
down upon a nearby stone and gazed at those
desecrated bodies, with hot tears starting from my
eyes at thought of the gallant man and fair woman
for whom this hideous fate had been reserved.
In that moment of anguish there was but one
comforting reflection—she had died with her husband’s
arms about her, his voice in her ears, his
kisses on her lips.</p>

<p>Yet, deserted, insentient as they were, I could
not leave these bodies here to rot in the sun, food
for carrion birds and unclean beasts of the night.
Nor could I spare the time to bury them, for the
sun was already sinking toward the horizon. I
glanced despairingly about me—then I saw the
way.</p>

<p>Twenty feet above the bed of the stream some
tremendous freshet had eaten into the bank and so
undermined it that it seemed to hang tottering in
the air. In a moment I had carried the bodies,
one by one, into the shadow of this bank and laid
them tenderly side by side. Then I hesitated—but
only for an instant. I went straight to the spot
where Pasdeloup lay, and half dragging, half
carrying, placed him at last beside his master,
where he surely had the right to lie—where I was
certain he would have wished to lie.</p>

<p>As I was about to turn away a sudden thought
struck me. I had donned my gayest suit the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
before,—the suit indeed I had not thought to wear
until I approached the high altar at Poitiers,—and
though it was already sadly soiled and torn,
it must still attract attention to a man with no
better means of conveyance than his legs. Here
was a disguise ready to my hand; for under the
rude garments which Pasdeloup had worn—stained
as they were with blood and dirt—no one
would suspect the Royalist. In a moment I had
stripped off his stockings, blouse and breeches,
cleaned the caked mud from them as well as I
could, and throwing my own garments over him,
donned his,—not without a shiver of repugnance,—taking
care to transfer to my new attire
my purse, my ammunition, and the one pistol
which remained to me, and to secure the knife
which had already done such execution, and which
I found gripped in his right hand. I tied his
coarse handkerchief about my head, and stopping
only for a little prayer clambered to the top of
the bank and with my sword began to loosen the
overhanging earth. Great cracks showed here and
there, and it must soon have fallen of its own
weight. So very little remained for me to do, and
at the end of a moment’s work I saw the cracks
slowly widen.</p>

<p>Then, with a dull crash which echoed along the
valley, the earth fell upon the bodies, burying them
to a depth of many feet, safe from desecration by
the fang of brute or the eye of man.</p>

<p>The tears were streaming down my face as I
turned away; but I could not linger, for darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
was at hand and I had already been too long absent
from my charge. I flung my sword far down the
cliff, for I would have no further need of it, then
with all the speed at my command I retraced my
steps along the bed of the stream and upward
toward the ledge of rock. As I approached it I
fancied I saw a figure slip quickly out of sight
behind the vines. Dreading I knew not what, I
hastened my steps, swept aside the curtain and
stooped to enter.</p>

<p>But even as I did so there came a burst of flame
almost in my face, and I felt a sharp, vivid pain
tear across my cheek.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="small">CIRCE’S TOILET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> blinded was I by the flash and by the swirl
of acrid smoke which followed it that for an
instant I thought there had been some terrible
explosion—another mine perhaps, designed to
wreck our cavern and entomb us beneath the
rocks. Then, in an agony of fear, not for myself,
but for the girl confided to my keeping, I sprang
forward, determined to close with my assailant
before he could fire again. Once my fingers were
at his throat, I knew he would never fire....</p>

<p>But at the third step I stumbled over some
obstruction and came headlong to the floor. I was
up again in an instant, my back to the wall, my
pistol in my hand, wondering at my escape. But
there was no second attack, not a sound, save my
own hurried breathing.</p>

<p>Then, as my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom,
I saw with astonishment that the cavern was
empty. What was it that had happened? Who
was it had fired that shot at me? What was the
obstruction which had brought me down? I could
just discern it on the floor before me—a dim,
huddled mass. I went to it, bent over it, peered
down at it—and in a sudden panic terror saw that
it was Charlotte! The fiends had been watching
then; they had seen me leave the cavern; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
had seen me desert her—fool that I was!—they
had waited till I was safely away; then they had
crept in upon her, surprised her as she slept,
secure in the thought that I was watching over
her!</p>

<p>With a groan of agony I groped for her wrist
and found myself clutching a pistol whose barrel
was still warm. In a flash I understood, and my
heart bounded again with joy, the while I cursed
my carelessness. It was she who had fired at me!
How was she to know me in this garb? She had
been watching for me outside the cave, and had
seen a brigand approaching her. She had slipped
behind the curtain, and a moment later I had burst
in upon her without a word of warning. Fool
that I was! Fool! Fool! And yet my heart
was singing with joy and thankfulness—joy that
she had escaped; thankfulness that she had turned
the pistol against me and not against herself!
Had she done that!—but I shook the thought from
me lest I break down completely.</p>

<p>I drew her to the entrance of the cavern that
the cool air of the evening might play upon her
face. At the end of a moment her lips parted in
a faint sigh, her bosom rose and fell convulsively
and she opened her eyes and stared up at me with
a gaze in which horror grew and deepened.</p>

<p>“Do you not know me, my love?” I asked.
“It is Tavernay. See!” and I snatched off Pasdeloup’s
knotted headgear.</p>

<p>The warm color flooded her face, and she sat
suddenly upright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Then it was you!” she gasped. “It was
you!”</p>

<p>“Yes;” and I laughed with the sheer joy of
seeing her again so full of life. “It was I at
whom you discharged your pistol. An inch to the
right, and I should not be talking to you now;”
and I placed my finger on the still smarting scratch
across my cheek.</p>

<p>She gave one glance at it, then fell forward,
sobbing, her face between her hands. What would
I not have given to take her in my arms—to hold
her close against my heart—to kiss away those
tears! But even in that moment there was about
her something which held me back; something
which recalled the promise I had made her; something
which bade me remember that she was in
my care, defenseless. So I stilled the hot pulsing
of my blood as far as in me lay, and even succeeded
in speaking with a certain coldness.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, touching her delicate,
quivering shoulder, “it was nothing—or rather
it was just what you should have done. The fault
was wholly mine. I should not have burst in upon
you like that; but I was so worried, so anxious to
know that you were safe. You were right in
shooting. If you had killed me it would have
been no more than I deserved. I blame only
myself, and bitterly. I was a fool. I hope you
will find it in your heart to pardon me.”</p>

<p>Her sobs had ceased, and as I finished she threw
back her hair and sat erect again. I saw with
astonishment and relief that she was smiling—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
I found her smile more disturbing than her
tears.</p>

<p>“Then we are quits, are we not,” she asked,
“since we each made a mistake?”</p>

<p>“You did not make a mistake,” I protested, “so
we are not quits until you have forgiven me.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a charming gesture.</p>

<p>“You are forgiven,” she said, “so far as you
need forgiveness. And now,” she continued,
drawing away the hand which I had not the
courage to relinquish, and rising quickly to her
feet, “what are your plans?”</p>

<p>“There is down yonder,” I answered, “a charming
little brook, which purls over the stones, and
stops to loiter, here and there, in the basins of the
rock. The water is very cool and clear.”</p>

<p>“Then come!” she cried. “Ah, I am desperately
thirsty and frightfully dirty. I am
ashamed for you to see me!”</p>

<p>“I was just marvelling,” I retorted, “that you
had kept yourself so immaculate. I cannot understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Immaculate!” she echoed, and set off down
the slope.</p>

<p>But suddenly she stopped.</p>

<p>“Shall we return?” she asked. “Shall we see
the cave again?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” I answered; “we must be
starting westward.”</p>

<p>“Then I must say good-by to it;” and she ran
back to the entrance, drew aside the curtain and
fell upon her knees. I saw her throw a kiss into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the darkness and her head bent for a moment as
though in prayer. I, too, closed my eyes and
prayed God that He would give me strength to
guide this woman through to safety. At last she
arose and rejoined me.</p>

<p>“It is a lovable cave,” she said, “and it kept us
safe. It would have been ungrateful to go away
without a word of thanks;” and somehow, for
me, as for her, the cavern in that instant assumed
a personality, benign and cheerful. I could fancy
it glowing with pleasure at thought of this last
good deed.</p>

<p>“You were right,” I agreed. “But then you
are always right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she protested quickly. “Sometimes
I am very wrong. But you will discover that for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Shall I? When?”</p>

<p>“All too soon, I fear;” and she looked at me
with a curious little smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!” I retorted, with conviction.</p>

<p>She only smiled again in a way I could not
understand, and blushed and went on without
speaking. Who can read a woman’s thoughts?
Certainly not I!</p>

<p>But I was fiercely, madly happy. For the
moment no thought of the future, of its penalties
and duties, shadowed me. I was content to be
here with this brave and lovely girl, alone with
her—a comrade and friend. Since nothing more
was possible,—since to friend and comrade I could
not add lover,—I would yet be happy in what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
granted me. And that I must be content with this,
I saw too well—not in any coldness or aversion,
but by a subtle change of manner, the merest
nuance of expression, which at the same time kept
me near to her, and yet held me away. On the
tower she had permitted my endearments, had
even raised her lips to mine; but that was looking
in the face of death at a moment when we need
take no thought for the future—at a moment when
she had wished to comfort me, and herself stood
in need of comfort. But we had emerged from
that shadow; there was the future again to be
reckoned with, and between us an impalpable but
invulnerable veil was stretched which I must never
hope to pass.</p>

<p>We reached the brook, and I placed two broad
flat stones at the edge of a little pool where the
lucid water paused for an instant before pursuing
its course along the rocky way, and watched her
while she stooped and drank. She had cast aside
her cloak, and I noted with a clear delight the
soft curve of her arms, the slim grace of neck
and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Now it is your turn, my friend,” she said, and
made room for me.</p>

<p>I knelt and drank too. How good the water
tasted! How it cleansed and purified the parched
throat! How it heartened the whole body!</p>

<p>“And now I shall use some of it externally,”
she said, as I stood aside; and I sat down on a
nearby rock to enjoy the spectacle.</p>

<p>She rolled back her sleeves and bound her hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
in a tight coil upon her head. Then from some
hidden pocket she produced a dainty handkerchief,
and dipping it in the stream, applied it vigorously
to face and neck. I saw her skin glow and brighten
under touch of the cool water; she seemed like a
nymph——</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked aside and caught my eyes.</p>

<p>“Is this the first time you have seen a lady at
her toilet, M. de Tavernay?” she asked, witheringly.</p>

<p>“The very first, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“And you feel no compunctions of conscience
for keeping your seat there?”</p>

<p>“None in the least,” I answered calmly. “I
must see that no enemy surprises you.”</p>

<p>“From which direction would an enemy
come?”</p>

<p>“Probably from down the valley.”</p>

<p>“You have eyes, then, in the back of your
head? How fortunate!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I glance around from time to time,” I
explained coolly. “Surely you would not deny
me the pleasure I have in looking at you! That
would be heartless!”</p>

<p>She glanced at me again, with a little pout.</p>

<p>“But I should think that you yourself would
feel the need of a bath,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“So that you might feel some pleasure in looking
at me?” I asked. “I know I must appear
a most hideous scoundrel. My skin is fairly
stiff with the dirt upon it; and yet I dare not so
much as touch it with water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Dare not?”</p>

<p>“A clean skin would hardly be in keeping with
this clothing,” I pointed out.</p>

<p>“That is true,” she admitted, with a swift glance
over it. “But why did you assume such a disguise?
Who will see you?”</p>

<p>“Many people, I am afraid. In the first place
we must have food.”</p>

<p>“It is useless to deny that I am very hungry,”
she agreed.</p>

<p>“Instead of seeking food, I fell asleep,” I confessed
miserably. “I shall never forgive myself.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! We both of us needed rest first
of all. Indeed I find the pangs of hunger rather
exhilarating—and how I shall relish the food when
we get it! But continue: whom else shall you
meet?”</p>

<p>“In the second place,” I went on, “I must ask
my way, since I am wholly unfamiliar with this
country.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“And in the third place, in a country even
thinly settled, we must be prepared for chance
encounters. To all the people we meet I must
appear a peasant in order to protect you.”</p>

<p>“To protect me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you are my prisoner—a spoil of war;
there is a price on your head which I am anxious
to secure. I may even have to be a little brutal
with you.”</p>

<p>“I pardon you in advance,” she smiled. “Do
not hesitate to be as brutal as is needful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“I had thought at first,” I explained, “of
endeavoring to get for you a disguise somewhat
like my own, but I saw the folly of the plan when
I came to consider it.”</p>

<p>“Why, pray?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mademoiselle,” I said, “you would be no
less beautiful in the dress of a peasant than in the
robe of a queen! Such a disguise would deceive
no one. On the contrary, it would serve only to
attract attention, since a diamond is never so
brilliant as in a tarnished setting.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, monsieur,” she said, bowing.
“That was very prettily turned. But since you
slumbered all the afternoon, where did you find
those garments? Had some one thrown them
away?”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I stammered, turning red
and white, for I had not expected the question.
“I—that is——”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she demanded, looking at me
steadily. “Do not fear to tell me. Oh, I have
been selfish! I have been thinking only of myself!
Where are the others, M. de Tavernay? Where
are our friends? Did they, also, escape?”</p>

<p>With her clear eyes upon me, it was impossible
to lie as I had intended doing.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered in a low voice, “they did not
escape.”</p>

<p>“They were captured?” she cried, her face
livid.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so bad as that! Thank God, not so
bad as that! Madame was killed by that first shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and died in the arms of the man she loved, smiling
up at him. M. le Comte and Pasdeloup met the
end as brave men should, facing the enemy. It
was only I who ran away,” I added, the tears
blinding me.</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a quick gesture of
sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p>“It was for my sake,” she said softly. “Never
forget that, my friend. In telling the story over to
yourself never forget that.”</p>

<p>“You are kind,” I murmured with full heart.
“That thought alone consoles me—it was not for
myself I fled.”</p>

<p>And then I told her of the grave which I had
improvised, of how I had placed Pasdeloup’s body
beside that of his master. She heard me to the end
with shining eyes; and when I had ended she sat
for a moment, her hand still in mine, her head
bowed; and I knew that she was praying.</p>

<p>“They are at peace,” she said at last, looking
up at me with eyes tear-dimmed. “Nothing can
harm them now. And God will avenge them.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” I answered, “for I am the
instrument which He has chosen.”</p>

<p>“The instrument?”</p>

<p>“I have sworn to kill the scoundrel who set
them on,” I said simply. “I know that He heard
the oath and approved it.”</p>

<p>She sat looking at me a moment longer, then
passed her hand before her eyes and rose to her
feet.</p>

<p>“You will keep the vow, M. de Tavernay,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
said quietly; “I am sure of it. And the same
God who listened and approved will see you safe
through for your guerdon at the end.”</p>

<p>“My guerdon!” I stammered, startled out of
my self-control. “Ah, mademoiselle, I crave no
guerdon; at least there is only one——”</p>

<p>She was looking at me steadily, and the words
died upon my lips, for the veil had fallen again
between us.</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur,” she said in another tone,
“we must be setting forward. See—it is growing
dark.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="small">THE FIRST VENTURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> turned our faces westward toward the sun,
whose last rays were gilding the clouds along the
horizon, following the little valley which had been
hollowed in the hills by the stream at which we
had drunk. As we went on, this valley opened
more and more, changing from a rough and precipitous
aspect to one smooth and rolling, giving
promise of human occupancy. Our most urgent
need was food, and I determined to apply for it
at the first house we came to, no matter what its
appearance,—first with silver, and if that failed,
with a loaded pistol as a persuasive.</p>

<p>So I kept a sharp lookout, but for nearly an
hour we pressed forward without catching a
glimpse of any human habitation save a few shacks
long since deserted and falling to decay. Plainly
this country had not escaped the blight which had
fallen on the rest of France—which swept the
peasants into the armies, drove the nobles abroad,
and left the fields deserted. Darkness closed in
about us as we went; but I still kept my eyes to
left and right, in the hope that they might be
greeted by a ray of light from some welcome
window.</p>

<p>At last my companion, who had kept close at my
heels, halted and sank down upon a hummock of
earth with a sigh of weariness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“I fear I must ask a breathing-spell, my friend,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I answered instantly. “I have
been thoughtless;” and I dropped beside her.
Even in the darkness I could see by the white face
she bent upon me how utterly spent she was, and a
sharp twinge of remorse seized me. “I strode
along without considering you!”</p>

<p>“You paid me the compliment of thinking me
not entirely a weakling,” she corrected, and smiled
wearily.</p>

<p>“You turn it skilfully,” I said. “At least, I
hope you will discourage any more such compliments.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she agreed; “I promise. But we
must be getting on;” and she attempted to rise.</p>

<p>I caught her arm and held her in her seat.</p>

<p>“We must be doing no such thing!” I retorted.
“It is worse than foolish to plunge ahead as we
have been doing, half-starved. You are going to
remain here and rest. I will make you a bed of
grass and leaves in this little hollow, and you will
lie here quietly and gaze at the stars, thinking
of me as kindly as you can, while I go in search
of food. I shall not be long away, and you will
be quite safe.”</p>

<p>She sat without answering, watching me while
I piled such dry grass as I could find into the little
hollow. At last it was ready.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, turning to her, “if you will rest
here——”</p>

<p>“You are very good to me,” she breathed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
took her place upon the couch I had provided,
which, I fear, was none too soft.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I answered, controlling myself with
a mighty effort as I bent above her and assured
myself that her cloak was snug about her; “I am
not wholly unselfish. I must keep you fresh; I
must not permit you to exhaust yourself, or you
will be getting ill, and then what should I do?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not be ill,” she said quite positively.
“I am not such a weakling as that!”</p>

<p>“Besides,” I added, “I am frightfully hungry;
I must have something to eat, if I commit murder
for it.”</p>

<p>“You will not expose yourself?” she asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“No; there is no danger,” I assured her.</p>

<p>“I shall pray for you,” she added calmly.
“And I fear there is one thing I must ask of
you.”</p>

<p>“Ask it,” I said.</p>

<p>“Before I left my room at the château,” she continued,
“I chose the heaviest shoes I had——”</p>

<p>There was no need that she should say more.
I bent and touched one of the little feet just peeping
from beneath the cloak. However heavy the
shoes had been, they were certainly far too light
for the rough service which had been exacted of
them. They were almost in tatters, and I could
guess how the sharp stones which had torn the
leather had bruised the tender flesh within. Yet
she had followed me without a sigh, without a
murmur! Impulsively I bent and kissed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
instep of the little shoe, then rose unsteadily to
my feet.</p>

<p>“I will get you another pair,” I said; “and if
I am to have any peace of mind, you must not
again permit me to forget your welfare, as I have
been doing. With the best intentions in the world,
I am only a selfish and obtuse fellow, with a brain
not bright enough to think of more than one thing
at a time.”</p>

<p>“I saw how your thoughts were occupied,” she
protested. “I knew that our safety depended
upon you, and I did not wish to disturb you.”</p>

<p>“To disturb me?” I echoed. “Ah, for once,
mademoiselle, you were not really kind; for by
keeping silent you have done more than that—you
have made me suffer. But there!—I am wasting
time, and I can guess your hunger by my own.
I will go. You are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“No,” she murmured; “and yet I hope that
you will not be long.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said; “no;” and not daring to trust
myself further, I turned and strode away through
the darkness.</p>

<p>Only the biting need for prompt and well-directed
action enabled me to master the sweet
emotion which those words, so softly uttered, had
awakened. But I managed to crush it down, to
put it behind me, and to address myself wholly to
the task in hand. I must get food at once, and at
any price. But food in such a wilderness!</p>

<p>Yet fortune favored me,—or perhaps the country
was not such a wilderness as I imagined,—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
at the end of ten minutes’ brisk walking I collided
with a hedge, and too rejoiced at the discovery
to heed the scratches I had sustained, I felt my
way along it and came at last to a gate. It was
not even latched, so I pushed it open and passed
through. Once on the other side of it, I found
myself in what seemed an orchard.</p>

<p>Arguing that where there was a hedge, a gate,
and an orchard, there must also be a house, I
pushed forward among the trees and came out at
last into the clear air beyond. At the first glance
I perceived a light just ahead of me, and made my
way toward it with a deep thankfulness readily
imagined. As I drew nearer I saw that the light
proceeded from the window of a small house
which I was evidently approaching from the rear.
I advanced cautiously and looked within. Three
men were sitting about a table on which was a
bottle of wine and the remains of a meal. They
were talking together with great earnestness.</p>

<p>There was no time for hesitation or the weighing
of risks, so I waited to see no more, but
hastened around the house. It fronted upon a
road which seemed wide and well kept—undoubtedly
a high-road, and not a mere country lane. A
creaking sign proclaimed the place an inn. I
raised the latch and entered, and without pausing
to look about me sat down at the nearest table
and rapped loudly. One of the three men whom I
had observed through the window arose and came
to me.</p>

<p>“You are the inn-keeper?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Yes,” he answered gruffly, his brows drawn
close with annoyance, not in the least in the
manner of a man welcoming a customer.</p>

<p>“Well, citizen,” I continued, “I am in great
haste—I am on an errand of importance; I must
be off at once. Can I have some food to take with
me—a fowl, say, and whatever else is at hand;
together with two bottles of wine?”</p>

<p>“All that may no doubt be had, citizen,” he
answered, relaxing nothing of his sinister expression.
“But there are certain difficulties in the
way.”</p>

<p>“Money you mean?” and I laughed and threw
two silver crowns upon the table. “Well, there
it is, and you cannot quarrel with it. I don’t offer
you assignats, mind you—and one doesn’t often
hear the ring of honest coin nowadays.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” he admitted; and his face relaxed
a little as he eyed the money. “But there
is yet another difficulty.”</p>

<p>“And what is it?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“The other difficulty,” he answered, watching
me keenly, “is that in giving you these provisions
I may be succoring an enemy of the Nation.”</p>

<p>I threw myself back in my chair and burst into
a roar of laughter. Looking back upon it, there
is no moment of my life of which I am more
proud than I am of that one.</p>

<p>“An enemy of the Nation!” I repeated, and
then fell suddenly silent and affected to study him.
“But how am I to know,” I asked at last, “that
that description may not really be deserved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
you? How am I to know that it is not some
villainy against the Nation which you are plotting
at that table yonder?”</p>

<p>He started, turned red, shifted under my gaze,
and I saw that I had won.</p>

<p>“I swear to you, citizen,” he began; but I cut
him short.</p>

<p>“And I also swear to you,” I retorted, “that I
am on the Nation’s business, which brooks no
delay. If you are a friend of the Nation, give
me food; if you are its enemy, refuse it. The
Nation knows how to punish, and its hand is
heavy. Shall I write your name in my little book,
and after it the word ‘suspect’? Come, prove
yourself a good citizen, and at the same time get
these pieces of silver for your pocket.”</p>

<p>He hesitated yet a moment, going from one foot
to the other in perplexity; but the silver, or my
arguments, or perhaps both together, carried the
day.</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” he said, and went to the
farther end of the room, where he opened a cupboard
which was at the same time larder and
wine-cellar. From it he produced two bottles, a
fowl already roasted, and a loaf of bread. As
he passed his two companions I fancied that a
glance of understanding passed between them. A
moment later they pushed back their chairs, bade
him a noisy good-night, and left the room.</p>

<p>“How will this do?” asked my host, placing
the bottles, the loaf and the fowl on the table
before me, his vexation quite vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Excellently,” I answered, noting with surprise
that the fowl had really some flesh upon its bones.
“One thing more: this road, I suppose, leads
to——”</p>

<p>“Loudun,” he said.</p>

<p>“And from there to Thouars?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“I am on the right track, then,” I said, simulating
a sigh of relief. “That is all,” I added;
for I saw it was useless, as well as dangerous, to
ask for shoes. “The silver is yours;” and while
he tested it with his teeth, I placed a bottle in either
pocket, and with the loaf under my arm, and the
fowl in my hand, opened the door and stepped out
into the night.</p>

<p>I had my pistol ready, and looked sharply to
right and left, but saw no one. Then, taking care
to walk in the middle of the road, I pushed forward
at a good pace until I was well away from
the inn. I glanced around from time to time, but
saw no sign that I was followed nor heard any
sound of pursuing footsteps. So telling myself
at last that my fears were groundless, I leaped the
ditch at the side of the road and retraced my steps,
until I came again to the hedge back of the inn.
From this I had but to follow the course of the
brook, here the merest thread of water, and at the
end of ten minutes I was back again at my starting-point.
I stopped and bent over the hollow,
when a soft hand rose and touched my cheek.</p>

<p>“Is it you, M. de Tavernay?” asked a voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
“Oh, but I am glad! I was beginning to fear for
you. What is that in your hand?”</p>

<p>“It is food,” I answered, sitting down beside
her and laughing with sheer joy. I drew my knife
and severed loaf and fowl alike into two equal portions;
then with the point of it drew the corks and
placed the bottles carefully in a hollow of the
grass, propping them upright with some little
stones. “There!” I said, “the meal is served.
I think we may dispense with grace, as we must
with knives and forks.”</p>

<p>She laughed delightedly as she took the portions
I placed in her hands.</p>

<p>“You are a wizard, M. de Tavernay,” she said.
“I had expected at most a crust of bread, and you
provide a feast.”</p>

<p>“A feast is of value,” I pointed out, “only
when it is in one’s stomach.”</p>

<p>“Well, this shall soon be in mine,” she retorted.
“Never in my life have I had such an appetite;”
and she attacked the food with a vigor which it
did me good to see.</p>

<p>Nor was I behind her. Never before or since
have I tasted a fowl so tender, bread so sweet,
wine so satisfying. It was almost worth the
privations we had undergone—it was nature’s
compensation for that suffering. And our first
hunger past, we took time to pause and chat a
little. She had regained all her old spirit, and
I am sure that for her, as for me, there was something
fascinating and even dangerous in that
moment. We forgot past sorrow and future peril;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
we forgot our present situation and the trials we
must still encounter. The moon was rising again
over the hills to the east, and revealed, just as it
had done the night before, all the subtle delicacy of
her beauty. What she was thinking of I know
not, but my own thoughts flew back irresistibly
to that hour in the garden—that sweet, swift-winged
hour!</p>

<p>“But was it only last night?” I murmured, not
realizing that I spoke aloud until the words were
uttered.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it seems an age away!” she assented
absently; and a sudden burst of joy glowed within
me.</p>

<p>“So you were thinking of it, too!” I cried, and
tried to catch her hand.</p>

<p>“Thinking of what?” she asked, drawing away
from me.</p>

<p>“Of the garden—of the few precious moments
we passed together there,” I answered eagerly, my
eyes on hers.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” she answered coolly, though
I could have sworn she blushed, “I was thinking
only that last night I was safe with my friends at
the château——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said, not waiting to hear more; and I
sank back into my seat with a gesture of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Though if you had not interrupted my
thoughts,” she continued, smiling slyly, “I should
doubtless in time have come to the garden scene.”</p>

<p>“In time!” I repeated bitterly. “Of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
hours of my life, that one is ever present with me.
It eclipses all the rest.”</p>

<p>“It will fade!” she assured me lightly. “It
will fade! As for me, I do not dwell upon it,
because I must be careful.”</p>

<p>“Careful?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Careful not to permit myself to
think too tenderly of a man already betrothed.
That would be the height of folly. Suppose I
should begin to love him!”</p>

<p>“I see you are armed against me,” I said dismally,
“and that the poniard of your wit is as
sharp as ever.”</p>

<p>“It is the instinctive weapon of our sex,”
she explained. “We draw it whenever we scent
danger. Once it fails us we are lost.”</p>

<p>“It failed you for a time last night, thank
God!” I retorted. “I have that to remember;”
and I recalled the sweet face raised to mine, the
yielding form——</p>

<p>“Ungenerous!” she cried. “I did not think
it of you, M. de Tavernay! Darkness and stress
of storm drive a bird to take refuge in your
bosom, and at daybreak you wring its neck!”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, with a sudden revulsion of feeling,
“I release it; I toss it back into the air; it
flies away without a thought of me, glad only to
escape; but I—I remember it, and love it, and I
thank heaven for the chance which drove it to
me.”</p>

<p>Impulsively she reached out her hand and
touched my own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“That is more like yourself,” she said. “Now
I know you again. And perhaps, my friend, the
bird is not so ungrateful as you think.”</p>

<p>“It may even return to the bosom which sheltered
it?” I asked softly, leaning forward. “You
think that, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“I fancy it would fear to do so.”</p>

<p>“Fear?” I repeated. “Surely—that least of
all!”</p>

<p>“Fear that it might not find the bosom empty,”
she explained remorselessly; and I saw the old
light in her eyes. “Fear that it might blunder
upon another occupant with a better right——”</p>

<p>I drew away from her, wounded, stung.</p>

<p>“But whether it returns or not,” she added in
a gentler tone, “I am sure it will never forget.”</p>

<p>And with that comfort, cold as it was, I was
forced to be content.</p>

<p>“Come,” I said, a sudden impatience of the
place seizing me, “we must be getting forward.
The moon will light our way.” And then my heart
fell suddenly; for I remembered her torn and
ragged shoes. “I could not get you shoes,” I
said.</p>

<p>“No one can accomplish the impossible. It was
foolish of me to ask for them.”</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> get them,” I said; “but until then I
shall have to carry you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she protested. “You will do
nothing of the kind. With that light in the sky I
can choose my steps. Besides, my shoes are
stronger than you imagine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“The road is not far off,” I said. “Once we
have gained that, you may perhaps be able to walk
alone. But I shall not permit you to torture yourself
by limping over this rough ground.”</p>

<p>She was looking at me with defiance in her eyes,
and I saw that I should have to use <i>finesse</i>.</p>

<p>“Please do not forget,” I reminded her, “the
selfishness of my disposition. One step upon a
sharp stone and you will be so lamed that I shall
have to carry you, not a matter of a few hundred
yards, but all the way to the Bocage. My back
aches at thought of it; and so I propose for myself
the lighter task, in order to escape the other.”</p>

<p>Her look changed from defiance to amusement.</p>

<p>“You have a wit truly ingenious, M. de Tavernay,”
she said. “I yield to it—for the moment.”</p>

<p>“I knew that reason would convince you,” I
replied, trembling at the thought that I should have
her in my arms again. “Come, there is still a
little wine in the bottles. I propose a toast—the
toast we drank last night;” and I arose and
bared my head. “God and the King!”</p>

<p>But that toast was never to be drunk; for even
as I raised the bottle, it was dashed from my lips,
and two men hurled themselves upon me out of the
darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="small">A DAGGER OF ANOTHER SORT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant I did not resist, so sudden and
unlooked-for was the attack; then, as I felt a
merciless hand gripping my throat, I struck savagely
at a face I could dimly see just in front of
my own. A burst of blood flooded down over it,
changing it into a hideous mask; but again I felt
those fingers of steel about my neck—fingers
which tightened and tightened, tear at them as I
might. In a mad frenzy of rage and agony, I
struck again and again at the face before me, until
my tongue swelled in my mouth and the heavens
danced red before my eyes. This was the end,
then! I was to be murdered here by these tavern
vagabonds. That vengeance I had sworn was
never to be accomplished; and Charlotte—Charlotte——</p>

<p>The pang which struck through me was not one
of physical suffering alone; indeed, for an instant
I ceased to feel those savage fingers. Ah, I could
die—that were nothing! But to leave her! Had
God abandoned us? Where was His justice?
Where was His mercy? Again I tore at those
fingers, desperately, madly. I felt the blood spurt
from my nostrils, the heavens reeled before me,
a black moon in a sky of living flame....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>What magic was it drew that breath of air into
my lungs?—life-giving air, which sent the heart
bounding and the pulse leaping in answer! A
second!—a third! I was dimly conscious of a
knife gleaming in the air. I struck again. The
face vanished from before me. But the fingers!—the
fingers!—they were buried in my flesh!—they
were crushing my life out! I raised a hand to my
throat. The fingers were not there! And again
the sky turned red, and a black moon hung low in
it—a moon which grew and grew, until it swallowed
the heavens and the earth....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was lying upon a vast bed of seaweed, which
rose and fell with the waves of the ocean. Oh, the
peace of it! the bliss of it,—save that from time
to time a single strand coiled about my throat like
a living thing, and would have choked me had I
not torn it off. The wish came to me that I might
lie there forever, rocked in that mammoth cradle,
lulled by the murmur of waters never ceasing.
Then, afar off across the undulating plain, I saw
a figure speeding toward me, and knew it was
my love. At last she reached me, bent above me,
looked into my face, flung herself upon me, calling
my name and pressing warm kisses on my lips—kisses
which I could not return, struggle as I
might, for my lips seemed frozen into stone.</p>

<p>I tried to throw my arms about her, but some
mighty weight held them at my side. I tried to
call her name, but my voice died in my throat.
Then I knew that I was dead, and a great sadness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
fell upon me. She would never know that I felt
her kisses, that I heard her voice. She would
never know how I loved her! The thought stung
me to fury. She must know! she should know!
For her I would burst the bonds of death itself!
I fought against them desperately, desperately,
every muscle strained to breaking....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I opened my eyes to see a face bending over
me—the face of my dream. Very near she sat,—so
near that I could feel the sweet warmth of her
body,—and she was bathing my face and neck
with the cool water from the brook. How good
it felt—like the hand of God Himself! I saw that
she had filled a bottle with it, and guessing the
wish I had not strength to utter, she held it to my
lips, and gave me a long draught.</p>

<p>It sent new life through me. The pain of
swallowing was as nothing to the delight it gave
me. I lay still a moment looking up at her; then
I sat erect unsteadily.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked hoarsely. “What has
happened to me?”</p>

<p>“Then you are not dead!” she cried. “Then
you are going to live! Oh, thank God!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” I repeated in amazement. “No—nor
like to be!”</p>

<p>Then my eyes fell upon an object at my feet,
and in a flash I remembered. I sat for a moment
looking down at that huddled shape, touched here
and there into hideous distinctness by the rays of
the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“But even yet I do not understand,” I said at
last. “What killed him? A bolt from heaven?
God saves me for my vengeance then!”</p>

<p>She did not answer, only huddled her head into
her arms and swayed forward, shaken by a convulsive
shuddering.</p>

<p>I leaned down and looked at the body. Was it
blasted, shrivelled as in a furnace? Had I really
been saved by God’s intervention? And how else,
I asked myself; what less than a miracle could
have saved me?</p>

<p>The body was lying on its face, and as I stared
down at it, I fancied I saw something protruding
from the back. I touched it—it was the handle of
a knife. I drew it forth, not without some effort,
and recognized the knife as mine—Pasdeloup’s—the
knife I had used to cut the bread—the knife
I had left lying in the hollow beside the bottles.
Then I understood.</p>

<p>“You!” I cried, staring at the bowed figure.
“You!”</p>

<p>She did not answer, only sat and shivered, her
head in her arms.</p>

<p>“You!” I said again. “It was you who saved
me?”</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked at me.</p>

<p>“I saw—that—he—was choking—you,” she
gasped. “God—guided my hand—to the knife;”
and she held it up and looked at it with a kind of
horror.</p>

<p>I caught the hand and drew it to my lips.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said hoarsely, “I loved you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
before—I reverence you now. But where is the
other? I thought there were two of them.”</p>

<p>“There were,” she answered. “The other
tried to stab you, but you struck him and he fled.”</p>

<p>I started up in alarm.</p>

<p>“Then must we flee too, and instantly,” I cried.
“He will return and bring others with him.
Come;” and I raised her to her feet.</p>

<p>“But are you strong enough?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Strong enough? I am strong as Hercules!
Why should I not be since joy gives strength?
Come.”</p>

<p>Then I remembered her ragged shoes. What
hope of escape was there when our flight must be
at a snail’s pace?</p>

<p>“Come,” I repeated; and held out my arms.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded, looking
at me darkly.</p>

<p>“I am to carry you, you know, until we reach
the road. That is already settled, so we need not
waste time arguing it over again.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” she retorted. “But that was under
different circumstances. Besides, we are not going
toward the road, are we?”</p>

<p>“No,” I admitted; “we are going straight up
this hill.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, “then our agreement
is at an end, and I refuse to reconsider. It is you
who are wasting time.”</p>

<p>I saw she was immovable, and a mad impulse
seized me to snatch her up despite her protests; to
overpower her resistance....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Then my glance fell upon the body. In an
instant I had dropped beside it and was pulling
the rude, strong shoes from its feet.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” she gasped, staring
down at me.</p>

<p>“Sit here beside me,” I commanded, my heart
beating triumphantly; and as she obeyed, still
staring, I pulled off my own shoes and slipped
them over hers. Worn in that way, they fitted
as well as could be desired; they would at least
protect her from the roughness of the road until
better ones could be found. Then I stuffed the
dead man’s shoes with grass until they fitted my
own feet snugly.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, “we are ready to be off;” and
I sprang to my feet and drew her after me.</p>

<p>“You are a most ingenious man, M. de Tavernay,”
she commented. “I am ready;” and she
followed me up the hill and through a thicket of
underbrush which crowned its summit.</p>

<p>Not a moment too soon; for as we paused to look
back before starting downward, we saw a score
of torches advancing up the valley toward the
spot which we had left. Evidently there was to
be no chance of failure this time.</p>

<p>“Come,” I said, and caught her hand.</p>

<p>The slope was free from underbrush and fairly
smooth.</p>

<p>“A race!” she cried, her eyes dancing; and a
moment later we arrived breathless at the bottom.</p>

<p>Here there was a wall of stone. We rested a
moment on top of it, then I helped her down into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the narrow, rutted road beyond. It ran, as nearly
as I could judge, east and west, and turning our
faces westward, we hurried along it, anxious to
put all chance of capture far behind.</p>

<p>The night was sweet and clear and my heart
sang with the very joy of living. I felt strong,
vigorous, ready to face any emergency. My
recent encounter had left no souvenir more serious
than a tender throat, and as I thought of it I
wondered again at the resolution which had nerved
that soft and delicate arm to drive the blade home
in the back of my assailant. She, too, had proved
herself able to meet a crisis bravely, and to rise to
whatever heroism it demanded.</p>

<p>Ah, if she only loved me! I might yet find some
way to evade with honor the unwelcome match
my father had arranged for me. But she did not;
so there was an end of that. I must go on to
the end, even as I had promised. But it was a
bitter thing!</p>

<p>“Why that profound sigh, M. de Tavernay?”
asked my comrade, looking up at me with dancing
eyes, quite in her old manner. “Surely we are
in no present danger?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking not of the present but of the
future,” I answered.</p>

<p>“You think, then, that danger lies before us?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly!”</p>

<p>“But why cross the bridge till we come to it?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I answered, “since the bridge must
be crossed it is as well to do it now as any time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“But perhaps it may be avoided—one can never
tell.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said gloomily, “it is a destiny not to
be escaped.”</p>

<p>“You frighten me!” she cried; but when I
glanced at her she looked anything but frightened.
“What is it that awaits us? Let me know the
worst!”</p>

<p>“It was of myself I was speaking,” I explained.</p>

<p>“Another instance of your selfishness! Are
you going to face the enemy and bid me run
away? Depend upon it, I shall think twice before
obeying.”</p>

<p>“This is an enemy which you will never be
called upon to face, mademoiselle. I was thinking
of that moment,—a moment not far distant,—when
I have placed you in the hands of your
friends and must bid you adieu.”</p>

<p>“To turn your face southward toward Poitiers?
Inconstant man! I did not think you so
eager!”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle; I turn back to Dange, as
you know, on an errand of vengeance, and
then——”</p>

<p>“To Poitiers on an errand of love. To the
hero his reward!”</p>

<p>“Say rather on an errand of duty,” I corrected.</p>

<p>“It will become an errand of love also, once
you have seen the lady—what is her name?”</p>

<p>“No matter,” I said shortly, and strode on in
silence.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay,” she said in a provoking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
voice, keeping pace with me, “I should like to
make you a wager.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked, none too gently.</p>

<p>“That my prediction will come true,” she
answered, laughing. “That you will fall madly
in love with this lady—oh, desperately in love with
her! and once you have safely married her will
remember this youthful passion only with a smile.
Come; the stake shall be anything you like.”</p>

<p>This time I was thoroughly angry. Even if
she did not love me she had no right to wound me,
to stab me deliberately, maliciously, with a smile
on her lips. She had no right to draw amusement
from my sufferings, to torture me just for the
pleasure of watching my agony. So I quickened
my pace and strode on in silence, my hands
clinched, trying to stifle the pain at my heart.</p>

<p>A touch on my arm aroused me.</p>

<p>“<i>Ciel!</i>” gasped a voice; and I turned to see my
companion still at my side indeed, but spent and
breathless. “Did you fancy these shoes of yours
were seven-league boots?” she questioned when
she could speak. “Or did you desire to abandon
me out here in this wilderness?”</p>

<p>“It would be no more than you deserve!” I
retorted; then, as I remembered how fast I had
been walking and pictured her uncomplaining
struggle to keep pace with me, I relented. “Pardon
me,” I said, humbly; “I am a brute. Come;
sit here in the shadow of this tree and rest. We
are beyond danger of pursuit—besides, no one
can see us here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>She permitted me to lead her to the shadow and
sat down. I leaned against the tree and stared
moodily along the road.</p>

<p>“What is it, monsieur?” she asked at last.
“Still brooding on the future?”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I answered; “since it
must be endured I shall waste no more thought
upon it.”</p>

<p>“That is wise,” she commended. “That is
what I have advised from the first. Besides, you
should remember it is when troubles are approaching
that they appear most terrible.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” I said dryly. “You are
no doubt right.”</p>

<p>“And then,” she added, “one grows morbid
when one thinks too much of oneself.”</p>

<p>“It was not wholly with myself I was occupied
this time,” I said; “or at least with myself
only in relation to you. I was thinking how unfit
I am to take care of you; how little I merit the
trust which M. le Comte reposed in me when he
gave you into my keeping. I permit you to limp
along behind me with bruised and wounded feet
until you sink exhausted; I lead two scoundrels,
whose pursuit I had foreseen, straight to your
hiding-place and would have perished but for
your courage and address; I stride along at top
speed until you are ready to die of fatigue; I show
myself a fool, a boor, and yet expect you to feel
some kindness for me. Hereafter you will command
this expedition; I am merely your servant;
I am at your orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Very well,” she responded instantly, “I
accept. My first order is that you sit here
beside me;” and she patted the spot with her
hand.</p>

<p>“A soldier does not sit in the presence of his
commander,” I protested.</p>

<p>“What! Rebellion already!” she cried. “A
fine beginning, truly!”</p>

<p>I sat down, a little giddy at this unexpected
kindness.</p>

<p>“And now,” she continued severely, “you
will repeat after me the following words: Mademoiselle
de Chambray——”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Chambray——”</p>

<p>“I know you are only a silly girl——”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of the sort,” I protested.</p>

<p>“Will you obey my orders, M. de Tavernay,
or will you not?” she inquired sternly.</p>

<p>“No one can be compelled to perjure himself,”
I answered doggedly.</p>

<p>“Nor shall I compel you to do so. We will
continue then: I know you are only a silly girl,
yet even a silly girl should hesitate to do a friend
malicious injury. Nevertheless I will forgive you,
for I see how you yourself regret it and I am too
generous to strike back, even though you deserve
it.”</p>

<p>I looked down at her and saw that there were
indeed tears in the eyes which she turned up to me.</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a little tremulous
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Will you not forgive me, my friend?” she
asked.</p>

<p>I seized the hand and covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>“I adore you!” I cried. “Adore you!—adore
you!”</p>

<p>And I would have asked nothing better, nothing
sweeter, than to die there at her feet, with her
warm hand in mine and her eyes enfolding me in
a lambent flame which raised me to a height that
kings might envy.</p>

<p>For in that instant I knew that she loved me.</p>

<span class="small">FALSE PRETENSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> only for the merest breath did she permit
her soul to stand unveiled before me. Then she
drew her hand away and fenced herself again with
that invulnerable armor.</p>

<p>“Come, my friend,” she said, and her voice
sounded a trifle unsteady in my ears, “we must
be going on—we have a long journey still before
us.”</p>

<p>I arose like a drunken man. I dared not believe
what that glimpse of glory had revealed to me;
it seemed too wonderful, too stupendous to be
true. I had looked into her soul and seen love
there—but was it really there? Or was it merely
the reflection of what my own soul disclosed?</p>

<p>I glanced down at her, but she was staring
straight before her as she walked steadily forward
with a face so cold and impassive that the doubt
grew, enwrapped me, darkened to conviction. It
was folly to suppose that her eyes had really
revealed their secret; it was absurd to believe that
such a secret lay behind them. Who was I that I
should hope to waken love in the breast of such
a woman as this? Pity, perhaps—sympathy,
friendship, kindness—anything but the deep,
splendid passion I hungered for. She had been
moved for the moment, but plainly she already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
regretted her emotion. Well, I certainly would
never remind her of it.</p>

<p>So we went on through the night, taking at
every forking of the road the way which led nearest
the west, for in the west lay safety. But I
knew we had ten leagues and more to cover ere
we should reach the Bocage, and the nearer we
approached our destination the more closely would
danger encompass us. From south and east
troops were being massed to crush out by sheer
weight of numbers the flame of insurrection which
had arisen so suddenly in the very heart of
France. From every town within fifty leagues
the National Guard had been summoned. From
Paris itself levies were hastening—levies of
Septembrists, cut-throats, assassins, asking nothing
better than permission to murder and pillage, and
commanded by a general determined not to fight
but to destroy, not to defeat but to exterminate—in
a word, not to rest until all Vendée had been
made a wilderness, a barren waste. This line of
enemies, marching forward in this temper, we
were forced to pierce in order to reach our friends.</p>

<p>The moon rose high in the heavens, paused at
the zenith, then started on its course down the
western sky. I thanked the fortune which gave
us her friendly light to guide us, for the road grew
ever more wild and rough. In one place indeed
it was merely the bed of a torrent little different
from that over which we had already toiled so
painfully. So we left it, and breaking our way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
through the hedge which bordered the road, followed
along beside it.</p>

<p>Even I was beginning to feel fatigued and I
could guess at my companion’s weariness, yet she
refused to listen to my suggestion that we stop
and rest. But dawn was not far distant and we
must find some safe hiding-place for the day.
There were no houses in sight, nor had we seen
any for some time, but where there was a road,
however bad, there must also be people to travel
it; and to seek rest, to resign oneself to sleep, save
in a safe covert, would be the height of folly.</p>

<p>The country had grown more open and level
with only an occasional tree here and there, and
was evidently used for pasturage, though I saw
no sheep nor cattle; but at last along a ridge at
our right I caught sight of a thicket, and toward
this we made our way. We found it a dense
growth of small saplings and underbrush and
broke our way into it with difficulty; but the event
repaid the labor, for at last we came to a little
glade not over a rod across and carpeted with
grass.</p>

<p>“Here is our resting-place,” I said, “and our
home for another day.”</p>

<p>My companion sank down with a sigh of utter
fatigue.</p>

<p>“I am very tired,” she murmured, and drew off
the shoes which I had slipped over her own.</p>

<p>“You are to sleep until you are quite rested,”
I added. “We will remain here until evening.
Then, after darkness falls and before the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
is up, we shall try to pierce the lines of the Republicans,
which cannot be far away. For that you
must be fresh, for we may need to be fleet.”</p>

<p>“But you?” she broke in quickly. “You are
going to sleep too?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” I answered. “Only first I
wish to assure myself that there is no house too
near us. Good-night, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my friend,” she said, looking up
at me with a little tremulous smile full of sorrow
and weariness.</p>

<p>I stood a moment gazing down at her, longing
to gather her in my arms, as one would a child,
and caress and comfort her and hold her so until
she fell asleep. But I managed to crush the longing
back and turn away to the task which I had
set myself.</p>

<p>The thicket crowned a low ridge which stretched
between two gentle valleys. That we had left
was, as I have said, innocent of human habitation.
In the one to the north I fancied I could discern
a group of houses, but they were so far away that
we need apprehend no danger from them. To the
westward, along the ridge, the thicket stretched
as far as I could see.</p>

<p>Assured that our hiding-place was as safe as
could be hoped for, I made my way back to it and
walked softly to the dark figure on the grass.
She was lying on her side, her head pillowed on
her arm, and as I bent above her to make sure
that she was protected from the chill of the night,
I knew by her regular breathing that she slept.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
That sleep, so peaceful and trusting, consecrated
the little glade—hallowed it, transformed it into
such a temple that I dared lay me down only upon
its margin, as though it were a holy place.</p>

<p>Long I lay staring up at the heavens, wondering
if I might indeed hope to win this superb creature;
weaving a golden future which we trod arm in arm.
To possess her, to have her always at my side, the
mistress of my home, the mother of my children—the
thought shook me with a delicious trembling.
But at last cold reason snatched me down from
this empyrean height. I told myself I was a fool,
and so turned on my side, closed my eyes resolutely,
and in the end sank to sleep.</p>

<p>I awoke with the full sun staring me in the
face and sat up with a start to find my companion
smiling at me across the little amphitheatre.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, monsieur,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” I responded, and rose and
went toward her.</p>

<p>In some magical way she had removed the
stains of travel; to my eyes she seemed to have
stepped but this moment from her bath. A
sudden loathing of my own foul and hideous clothing
came over me. How, in that guise, could she
regard me with anything but disgust?</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, “I am ashamed to
stand here before you in this clear light, for you
are sweet and fresh as the morning, while I——”</p>

<p>“Choose the harder part,” she interrupted, “in
order to serve me better.”</p>

<p>“But to be hideous——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Oh, I do not look at the clothes,” she said;
“and as for the face——”</p>

<p>“Well,” I prompted, “as for the face——”</p>

<p>She stole a glance at me.</p>

<p>“As for the face,” she continued, “you will
remember that I bathed it last night, monsieur,
while I was attempting to revive you, and so it is
nearly as attractive as nature made it.”</p>

<p>“A poor consolation,” I retorted.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, looking at it critically, “I
confess I have seen handsomer ones.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” I encouraged, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>“But never one I liked better,” she added, a
heavenly shyness in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, suddenly taking my
courage in my hands, “last night while I was
unconscious I dreamed such a beautiful dream.
I wonder if it was true?”</p>

<p>She glanced again at me hastily and her cheeks
were very red.</p>

<p>“Dreams are never true,” she said decidedly.
“They go by contraries. You will have to
bedaub your face a little before you venture forth
again.”</p>

<p>“But the dream,” I insisted, refusing to be
diverted. “Shall I tell you what it was?”</p>

<p>“I have never been interested in dreams,” she
responded calmly, and brushed from her skirt an
imperceptible speck of dust.</p>

<p>“But perhaps this one——”</p>

<p>“Not even this one, I am sure. How long are
we to remain here, M. de Tavernay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>I surrendered in despair before the coldness of
her glance.</p>

<p>“You are to remain till evening,” I replied.
“But I must go at once. My first task will be
to get some food. Hunger is an enemy which
always returns to the attack no matter how often
it is overcome.”</p>

<p>“And so is a foe to be respected and appeased
rather than despised,” she added smiling; “I came
across some such observation in a book I was
reading not long ago. It had a most amusing old
man in it called The Partridge,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who was always
hungry.”</p>

<p>“I can sympathize with him,” I said. “My
own stomach feels particularly empty at this
moment; I must find something to fill it—and
yours, too.”</p>

<p>“But I fear for you,” she protested. “I wish
you would not go. I am sure we can get through
the day without starving. I should prefer to try,
rather than that you should again run such risks
as you did last night.”</p>

<p>“Those risks were purely the result of my own
folly,” I pointed out. “I shall not be such a fool
a second time. There is a village down yonder
and I shall breakfast at the inn like any other
traveller. It was my haste last night which
aroused suspicion. Besides,” I added, “I doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
if any one could follow even me by daylight without
my perceiving it. You may have to wait an
hour——”</p>

<p>“It will not be hunger which distresses me,”
she interrupted earnestly, “but fear for your
safety. Let us do without the food.”</p>

<p>“It is true we shouldn’t starve,” I admitted,
“but for to-night we must be strong, ready for
anything. A fast is bad preparation for the kind
of work we have before us. Besides, I must find
where we are, how the Republican forces are disposed,
and the nearest point at which we may find
friends. We must guard against the possibility
of blundering haphazard into some trap and so
failing at the last moment.”</p>

<p>“You are right, of course,” she agreed instantly,
though her face was very pale. “I will wait for
you here, and pray for you.”</p>

<p>She gave me her hand and I bent and kissed it
with trembling lips.</p>

<p>“There will be no danger,” I assured her again,
waved my hand to her and plunged into the thicket.</p>

<p>I made my way through it for some distance
before venturing into the open; then, under shelter
of a hedge, I hastened down the slope, gained the
road and turned my face toward the village. Ten
minutes brought me to it—a straggle of sordid
houses along each side the road teeming with dirty
children and with a slatternly woman leaning in
every doorway. There was an inn at either end
to catch the traveller going east or west and I
entered the first I came to and asked for breakfast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
It was served by a pert and not uncomely maid,—bacon,
eggs and creamy biscuits,—and I fell to
it with an appetite tempered only by the thought
that I must eat alone. There was at the time no
other guest, and as the maid seemed very willing
to talk, I determined to turn her to account.</p>

<p>“These are delicious biscuits,” I began. “I
have tasted none so good since I started on this
journey.”</p>

<p>She dropped me a curtesy, flushing with
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Have you come a long journey, monsieur?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“What!” I cried. “You still say ‘monsieur’!
Is it a royalist then with whom I have to deal,—a
<i>ci-devant</i>,—an aristocrat?”</p>

<p>“A royalist?” she repeated, visibly horrified.
“Oh, no; but the habit is an old one.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted, “old habits are hard to
break; even my tongue slips sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” she added, looking at me steadily,
“there was about you something which made me
hesitate to call you citizen.”</p>

<p>It was my time to flush. I found myself unable
to meet her clear eyes and covered my confusion
clumsily by a laugh which even I perceived did
not ring true. If my disguise was so easily penetrated
it was time I was getting back to my hiding-place.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” I retorted. “It is proper to say
citizen to any one. And, by the way, citizen, what
is the name of this village?”</p>

<p>“What, you don’t know!” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Is that wonderful? It hardly seemed to me a
second Paris.”</p>

<p>“Yet you come to it!”</p>

<p>“I pass through it because it happens to be in
my way; I stop for breakfast—I would wish to
stop longer,” I added with an expressive glance,
“but the Nation needs me.”</p>

<p>“Needs you?”</p>

<p>“As she needs every man she can get to stamp
out those cursed rebels in Vendée.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so it is there you go?” she said, her face
clearing. “Yes—you are right. My father went
yesterday to join the Blues; our guard marched
last night. There is scarcely a man left in the
village.”</p>

<p>“And now perhaps you will tell me its name,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“It is called Dairon.”</p>

<p>“And where is the nearest Republican force?”</p>

<p>“There is a small one at Airvault and another
at Moncontour; but if it is fighting you are looking
for, citizen, you will press on to Thouars.”</p>

<p>“How far is Thouars?”</p>

<p>“Four leagues, and this road will lead you
there.”</p>

<p>“Then it is this road I will take. So there is to
be fighting at Thouars?”</p>

<p>“Our officers dined here last night,” she explained,
“and I heard them talking. It seems
that the brigands are gathering at Coulonges and
expect to take Thouars. Bah! The Blues will
fall upon them, surround them, exterminate them!
For do you know what it is that they are planning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
those scoundrels? They are planning to hold a
place where that ogre of a Pitt may land his
troops upon the sacred soil of France!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were blazing. I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>“Then I must be off!” I cried. “I can’t afford
to miss that fun. But first, citizen, can you put
me up a lunch for the road—a big one, for I have
the devil of an appetite. Ransack your larder—I
can pay for it;” and I laid a golden louis on the
table. “In the vicinity of an army there is never
anything to eat. I shall no doubt meet plenty of
poor fellows with nothing in their bellies, and
two or three bottles of wine would not be amiss.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” she nodded, and flew to the kitchen,
where I heard her and another woman talking
vigorously together to the accompaniment of a
clatter of knives and dishes.</p>

<p>I walked to the door and looked down the village
street. It was still deserted, save for the
women and children. Evidently the men had all
been caught in the dragnet of the Blues, or had
hurried into hiding for fear they would be drafted
to the front. How these poor creatures, left here
to their own resources, managed to exist I could
not imagine.</p>

<p>“Well, citizen,” asked a voice, “how is this?”</p>

<p>I turned to find the maid smiling up at me and
in her hand a hamper filled to the brim and covered
with a cloth through which the necks of three
bottles protruded.</p>

<p>“Excellent!” I cried as I took it. “That will
make me welcome, at any rate. A thousand
thanks, my dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“There is one more thing I can do for you,”
she said. “Your disguise is a poor one, citizen.”</p>

<p>“Disguise!” I echoed, my heart in my throat.</p>

<p>“Because the face does not match the clothes,”
she went on imperturbably. “Any fool could see
that these rags do not belong to you. Sit here a
moment.”</p>

<p>I sat down obediently, not daring to disobey.
Whereupon she produced a greasy rag and rubbed
it over my face, retiring a step or two from time
to time to admire the effect, and then returning to
add another touch, much in the manner of an
artist engaged upon a masterpiece. At last she
was satisfied.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “I defy any one to detect
you now. And remember, as long as you wear
those rags you are not to wash face or hands.
Your business is none of mine, but you are too
pretty a fellow to be permitted to run your head
into a noose.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear!” I said again, and rose
and took up my hamper.</p>

<p>She came to me and stood on tiptoe.</p>

<p>“A salute for the Nation, citizen,” she said, and
kissed me on either cheek. “If you return this
way you are to stop here and inquire for Ninette.
She will be glad to see you. Adieu—and may
the good God have you in His keeping.”</p>

<p>I turned westward along the street, unheeding
the curious glances cast at me, with a conscience
not wholly at peace. I had secured these generous
provisions under false pretenses. I had not merited
those pure kisses.</p>

<span class="small">THE PONIARD AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> until a turn of the road hid me from the
village and I was satisfied that I was unobserved
did I turn aside and, again sheltering myself
behind a friendly hedge, gain the thicket which
stretched along the ridge. Then plunging into
its cover I hastened back with what speed I could
toward the spot where I had left my comrade,
uneasily conscious that I had lingered at the inn
longer than I had thought to do, for the sun told
me that noon had come and gone.</p>

<p>So it was with an anxiety which increased at
every step that I broke my way through the underbrush,
unheeding the briers which clutched at my
clothes and stung hands and face—an anxiety
which leaped to mortal anguish as I came out suddenly
into the little amphitheatre where I had
left her and saw at a glance that it was empty.</p>

<p>I set down the hamper with a groan of agony
and wiped the cold sweat from my forehead.
Fool!—idiot that I was to leave her unguarded for
so long a time! Some one had blundered into our
retreat, had discovered her, had taken her prisoner.
This thicket doubtless harbored many scoundrels
seeking to evade the draft. Perhaps even at this
moment——</p>

<p>“Good-day, M. de Tavernay,” called a gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
voice; and I turned my head mechanically, to see
her emerging from the thicket, her face alight.
“So you have returned!”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” I cried. “Thank God! You
are safe, then!”</p>

<p>“Safe?” she repeated, eyeing me a little curiously.
“But certainly! What did you imagine?”</p>

<p>“I feared you had been captured,” I answered
hoarsely. “Carried away! No matter, since you
are safe.”</p>

<p>“I heard some one approaching,” she explained,
still eyeing me, “and decided I would better conceal
myself until I was certain it was you. That
was wise, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Wise? Oh, yes! But I thought I had lost
you! I had stayed away so long.”</p>

<p>“And in truth,” she went on, laughing again,
“I am not yet quite certain that it is really you.
What a villainous countenance!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, flushing. “The—the girl at the
inn fixed it for me.”</p>

<p>“So!” she cried. “It was a girl that kept
you—and pretty, I’ll be bound! To think that I
have been worrying about you!”</p>

<p>“You must be nearly starved,” I said, anxious
to change the subject.</p>

<p>“I confess a lively pleasure at the sight of that
hamper. May I explore it?”</p>

<p>“At once,” I urged, and sat down a little
weakly, for I was not yet wholly recovered from
the swift reaction from that agony of fear.</p>

<p>She spread upon the grass the cloth with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the hamper was covered and uttered little cries of
delight as she drew forth its contents and arranged
them before her.</p>

<p>“Why, you are a wizard, M. de Tavernay!”
she cried when the hamper was empty. “Here is
a feast fit for a king. That girl must have fallen
desperately in love with you! A real passion!
Poor creature!”</p>

<p>“I posed as a Republican,” I explained. “She
is a good patriot and anxious to serve the Nation.”</p>

<p>“Especially when it is personified by a handsome
and gallant fellow,” she amended. “No
matter; I am not jealous. Indeed I have no right
to be. But I wonder what the betrothed would
say? Rest easy; she shall never know, I promise
you that. And now, if you will draw the corks,
we are ready to begin.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you in such spirits,” I remarked
with irony as I got out my knife.</p>

<p>“It is so much pleasanter than being dull and
gloomy, is it not?” she agreed.</p>

<p>“You remind me of a red Indian,” I continued
as I drew the corks, “dancing around his captive
and burying a barb in his flesh from time to time
just to see his anguish.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she retorted, “I am going to treat you
as no red Indian ever treated a captive. Sit down
and share the feast.”</p>

<p>“But I have already eaten,” I protested. Nevertheless
I sat down in the place she indicated.
“Besides, my fright when I found you gone killed
any return of appetite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Were you really frightened?”</p>

<p>“Horribly!”</p>

<p>“I know what you need—a draught of wine.”</p>

<p>“If you will drink first,” I agreed.</p>

<p>She raised a bottle to her lips, then handed it to
me.</p>

<p>“You were right,” I said, as I put it down.
“That was really what I needed. My heart is
bounding again, though perhaps not wholly from
the wine.”</p>

<p>She smiled as she looked at me.</p>

<p>“Whatever the cause, I am glad to see you
more like yourself. And now you will eat—I
detest eating alone.”</p>

<p>“I will try,” I said; but I confess I found eating
a difficult task with that vision across from
me.</p>

<p>“Did you learn where we are?” she asked at
last.</p>

<p>“The village is called Dairon. We are about
four leagues from Thouars, where the Blues are
in force. We must get past them somehow to
Coulonges, a league beyond, where we shall find
friends.”</p>

<p>“And we must wait until to-night to go forward?”</p>

<p>“Till twilight, at least.”</p>

<p>“We should get to Coulonges to-night, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered with a sinking heart at the
thought that my dream was to end so soon. “If
all goes well we should reach Coulonges by midnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“You actually say that in a tone of despondency!”</p>

<p>“And do you see in it nothing to regret,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“To regret? Assuredly not! Shall you regret
being in safety?”</p>

<p>“Danger is not the worst thing that can befall
a man,” I said, “more especially——”</p>

<p>“Well?” she questioned tantalizingly as I
hesitated.</p>

<p>I leaned across the cloth and caught her hands
and held them prisoner.</p>

<p>“More especially when it is shared by the
woman he loves,” I continued, throwing discretion
to the winds. “Ah, then he forgets the danger,
mademoiselle! He remembers only that she is
beside him,—that he may look into her eyes as I
look into yours,—that he may kiss her hands as
I kiss these dear ones. And when he knows that
to restore her to her friends is to sever himself
from her, he may well despond as he sees the hour
approach.”</p>

<p>She sat looking at me, the color coming and
going in her cheeks, her lips parted, her eyes a
little misty. And she made no effort to take her
hands away. Ah, what a woman she was! The
beauty of her!—the whiteness, the delicacy, the
slim grace!—and with it all, a woman’s passionate
heart, a woman’s power of loving and desire of
being loved! It was there, I knew, waiting to be
awakened, needing only the touch of a certain
hand, the sound of a certain voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“You really love me!” she murmured. “You
really love me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest!” I cried. “Can you doubt
it? Looking into my eyes, can you doubt it?
And last night, looking into yours, I fancied that
you swept aside the veil for a moment, and that I
saw into your heart, your soul, and read a secret
there which made me madly happy! Did I read
aright?”</p>

<p>“Not to value your devotion would be indeed
ungrateful, monsieur,” she answered in a
whisper——</p>

<p>“It is not gratitude that I ask,” I broke in.
“It was not gratitude that I saw! Did I read
aright?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I say yes,” she said; “what is it you
propose?”</p>

<p>“I propose to take you and keep you,” I
answered madly, drawing her toward me, my
blood on fire. “You do love me!—come, confess
it! Look into my eyes and tell me! I defy the
whole world to take you from me now!”</p>

<p>She swayed toward me for an instant, her lips
parted, her eyes swimming in a veil of tears. I
had won! I had won! Then she drew her hands
away and sat erect, a convulsive shiver running
through her.</p>

<p>“And your honor,” she asked, her face suddenly
white—“what of it? The word you have given—what
of it? The vow you have taken—what of
it? And if I did love you—do you not see that
it is the man of honor that I love? Do you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
I could keep on loving a dishonored man—even
though that dishonor were incurred for me? Do
you think I could find any place in my heart for
a man unfaithful to such a vow as you have taken?
No, no!—you cannot believe that!—you cannot so
mistake me! I have built a temple for you in my
heart—do not tell me that you are unworthy to
dwell there!”</p>

<p>I was struck dumb before her. I could find no
word of answer. She was right—a hundred times
right. And by the trembling which shook her I
saw that it was not I alone who suffered.</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” I groaned. “Forgive me!”
and I flung myself forward at her feet.</p>

<p>But her arms were about me, and she raised me
up and kissed me on the forehead, and her eyes
were shining, and her face was very pale.</p>

<p>“Be brave!” she whispered brokenly. “Be
brave, my friend! The future will be brighter
than you think. Oh, you are worthy to occupy
that temple! Oh, I must——”</p>

<p>A sudden rattle of arms and tramp of feet rose
to us from the valley.</p>

<p>“What is that?” she asked with bated breath.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, went cautiously to the edge
of the thicket and looked down. A regiment was
marching westward along the road by which we
had come—a regiment dusty and travel-stained,
with tri-colored cockades in their hats and tri-colored
scarfs about their necks. I watched them
until they disappeared around a turn of the road.
Then I rejoined my comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“It was a regiment of Blues,” I said; “that is
bad. I had hoped to take that road. Now we
must take the other; but we must keep to the cover
of this thicket until we are past the village. We
would better be starting now while there is light;
then at dusk we can descend to the road and
hasten on to Coulonges.”</p>

<p>She was replacing the food in the hamper before
I had finished.</p>

<p>“We may need it,” she said; “you shall not
risk yourself again.”</p>

<p>She was entirely self-controlled and turned to
me the old, clear, friendly gaze; the emotion which
had shaken her a moment before had been conquered
and swept aside. What was it she had
been about to say? Should I ever know? Should
I ever again get past the barrier of her reserve?</p>

<p>I watched her as she slipped my shoes over her
own again and fastened them. Then I took up
the hamper and started. At the edge of the little
glade she paused and threw a kiss back to it.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” she called. “Good-by. You also
have kept us safely. I shall always remember!”</p>

<p>I dared not look back. I felt that I was forever
leaving a spot more dear and sacred than home
itself. So I strode blindly on, hurling myself
savagely at the underbrush, until the very fury of
my exertions served to exhaust the fire which
raged within.</p>

<p>“Am I going too fast?” I asked, pausing and
turning to her, for her footsteps told me that she
was close at my heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“No,” she said, “but you must be tiring yourself
terribly, and to little useful purpose.”</p>

<p>“It was the brute fighting itself out,” I explained;
“exhausting itself by bruising and
trampling down those poor little saplings.”</p>

<p>“And is it quite exhausted?”</p>

<p>“I trust so. Do you never have an impulse to
destroy things—to rend them apart and shatter
them to bits?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” she admitted, laughing. “It’s
like a thunderstorm, isn’t it—all fire and fury
while it lasts, but leaving one cleansed and purified.
Oh, I am far from perfect,” she added, laughing
again as she caught my glance, “as you would
have seen for yourself long ere this had you been
of an observing turn. Is this as far as we go
through this thicket?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, checking the words which
rose to my lips; and I set off again, nor paused
until the village had sunk from sight behind us.
“Now we can rest,” I said, and sat down at the
edge of the bushes.</p>

<p>She sat beside me and leaned her chin upon her
hand as she gazed down into the valley. The sun
was sinking to the west and the road seemed the
merest yellow ribbon between its green hedges.
Far ahead I could see that the country again
became more broken, and a low range of purple
hills closed in the horizon.</p>

<p>As we sat there silent, a cloud of dust appeared
far down the road, and we moved deeper into the
cover of the bushes, fearing that it was another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
regiment approaching. But it was only a flock of
sheep, driven by three shepherds.</p>

<p>“Food for the enemy,” I remarked. “That
explains why there are no longer any flocks in
these pastures. The Republic has swallowed them,
as it has swallowed so many other things.”</p>

<p>We watched them until they passed from sight
on the horizon behind a cloud of dust which rose
and rose until it covered the sun’s face.</p>

<p>“Yonder behind that cloud lies Thouars,” I
said.</p>

<p>“And a league beyond is Coulonges—and our
friends,” she added.</p>

<p>“Always thinking of that!” I rejoined bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes—of safety and home. How I shall
delight to be there again!”</p>

<p>“Home! And I do not even know where that
is! Why is it, mademoiselle, that you have told
me nothing of yourself? Do you mistrust me?”</p>

<p>“Mistrust you?” she repeated. “What an
absurd question! But there is so little to tell.”</p>

<p>“And you refuse to tell me even that? I know
nothing of you except your name. How am I to
find you again, if fate is indeed kind to me?
Where am I to look for you?”</p>

<p>“A perfect lover would have trusted his heart
to lead him,” she retorted. “But since you do not,
you may as well know that the Château de
Chambray is two leagues south of Poitiers.”</p>

<p>“Then,” I said, “I shall not have far to go
if—if—pray heaven it may be my fortune to seek
you there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>I could see by her sparkling eyes that the spirit
of mischief had sprung to life again.</p>

<p>“We shall be very glad to welcome you, my
father and I,” she said, without permitting me to
finish. “Perhaps we can even persuade you to
bring your betrothed with you. Why not spend
your honeymoon at Chambray, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“I should like to spend it there,” I retorted,
“but with another woman.”</p>

<p>It was her turn to redden, and she did so in
good earnest.</p>

<p>“Do you think fortune will favor me that far?”
I persisted.</p>

<p>Then she armed herself and struck me a savage
blow.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered quickly; “I think fortune
will hold you to your promise and that you will
soon forget to rail at her. Your heart is exceedingly
inflammable and will burn none the less
ardently, whether it be I or your betrothed who
applies the spark.”</p>

<p>“If that is your opinion,” I returned bitterly,
“there is nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p>“And I am quite certain,” she added, smiling
strangely, “that you will one day accept that invitation.
My father will insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“Let him!” I retorted. “Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. This hamper, then, we will leave here,
as we shall reach Coulanges to-night. It is time
we were setting off.”</p>

<p>She arose without a word and followed me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
down the slope. Only, when at last I glanced back,
did I perceive that she was bearing the hamper.</p>

<p>“Why are you bringing that?” I demanded,
wheeling sharp around.</p>

<p>“Food is not plentiful enough in France to be
wasted in that way,” she answered evenly.</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I propose to leave it at the door of the first
hut we reach;” and she made a motion as though
to pass me.</p>

<p>I seized the hamper roughly and strode on
through the dusk, marvelling at the inconsistencies
of a heart which could be at the same time so
cruel and so tender.</p>

<span class="small">FORTUNE FROWNS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> gained the road again and turned westward
along it, walking for some time in silence. I
confess I was in bad humor. I was not altruist
enough to burden myself willingly with that
hamper, and more than once I was tempted to
fling it into the ditch at the roadside, especially
as minute followed minute and no house appeared.
But at last at a turn of the road we came upon a
miserable hovel supported by a pile of stone, without
which it must inevitably have collapsed. I
thought for an instant that the hut was empty,
but as we drew near a child’s thin wail came to
us through the open door. I set the hamper down,
knocked and passed on, and I doubt not that in
that family there still survives the legend of a
heavenly visitation.</p>

<p>My spirit cleared after that, perhaps as the
reward of a good action, perhaps because I was
rid of the hamper; at any rate, I could lift my
head and look about me and take joy in the beauty
of the night. There were only the stars to light
us, for the moon had not yet risen. They looked
down upon us from the high heavens, and it
seemed to me that there was kindness and sympathy
in their gaze—that they blessed us and
wished us well. The road was much smoother
than the one we had traversed the night before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and we got forward at a speed which warranted
our reaching Coulonges in good time if nothing
happened to delay us. We were both well rested
and I already had good reason to know and
wonder at my companion’s powers of endurance.</p>

<p>I glanced down at her and saw that she was
staring straight ahead at the road unrolling before
us. How near we were to the moment of parting!
With every step we approached the place where I
must leave her. Even should I survive my pilgrimage
of vengeance, it seemed most unlikely
that I should see her again—certainly we should
never be thrown together in this sweet, intimate,
personal relation. And would I wish to see her
in any other way? To gaze at her from a distance,
to find her fenced about, to stand silent
while some other gallant whispered in her ear—would
not all that be as the rubbing of salt into an
open wound?</p>

<p>Indeed she had already applied that torture with
that mocking invitation to Chambray. Why was
it that I had so failed to touch a responsive chord
in her? Or rather why, at the very moment I
fancied I had touched it, should she draw back
and deal me a cruel blow? Perhaps she fancied
there was kindness in this cruelty; perhaps she
was trying to save me from sinking too deeply
into the quicksand which entangled me. Alas!
I felt that I was already past all hope of rescue.
So a real kindness would have been to make my
last moments as happy as might be ere the sands
closed over me and divided us forever!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>I shook the thought away. Nothing on earth
should so divide us. Honor compelled no man
to wreck his life beyond redemption. But as I
turned the problem over in my mind, I confess
my heart sank. So long as Mlle. de Benseval
lived, just so long was I bound to her. That was
the final statement to which the tangle reduced
itself, and I reflected bitterly upon the folly of
parents who disposed of their children without
asking their consent, or indeed before they were
old enough to know to what they were consenting.
A boy of ten will blithely promise to marry any
one, or will bind himself indifferently with a vow
of celibacy, for what does he know of either?
Only when he comes to look at the world and the
women in it with a man’s eyes does he understand.</p>

<p>“What is it, Sir Sorrowful?” asked my companion
at last. “The old problem?”</p>

<p>“The old problem.”</p>

<p>“Why ponder it? You have already said that
no man can escape his destiny.”</p>

<p>“I am going to escape mine if it be possible.”</p>

<p>“Is escape worth so much worry?”</p>

<p>“It is all the difference between hell and
heaven!”</p>

<p>“Oh, fie! What would the betrothed think
could she hear you?”</p>

<p>“I wish she could!” I retorted bitterly.</p>

<p>“Ah, M. de Tavernay,” and her voice had a
note of sadness in it, “I thought you a gallant
man. I thought you brave enough to approach
your fate with a smile upon your lips. I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
you generous enough to make this girl who is
waiting for you believe that you really loved her.
Consider how much more difficult is her task.
Perhaps she remembers you only as a thoughtless
and unattractive boy; perhaps she also has seen
some one whom she fancies she could love better;
perhaps it is some one who is really better worth
loving. Yet she is awaiting you, stifling her misgivings
in her bosom, ready to keep her oath,
although an oath is not the same thing to a woman
as to a man. Nor is marriage the same thing. To
a man it is an episode; to a woman it is her whole
life. She belongs to the man she has married.
Do you think the woman to whom you are betrothed
does not realize all this? Be sure she
does—and trembles at it. And you propose to
make her task more difficult still. You will come
to her with a sour and downcast face; you will
say to her as plainly as if you spoke the words,
‘I do not love you; I take you because I must. If
I were free I would not look at you a second time;
I am making a martyr of myself by marrying you.’
Which do you think will be the greater martyr,
monsieur, you or she? You are right in your estimate
of yourself—you are wholly selfish.”</p>

<p>I had listened with bowed head and quivering
nerves. Every word burnt into me as a white-hot
iron.</p>

<p>“You are right,” I said hoarsely, when she had
finished. “I am a coward—a cur. I am not
really a man of honor.”</p>

<p>“You are only a boy,” she said; and her tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
was more tender. “You have been too long in
your mother’s leading-strings. But you have in
you the making of a man, my friend, and I know
that I shall live to be proud of you.”</p>

<p>I caught her hand and kissed it—a kiss not of
love but of gratitude. I swear that at that moment
passion was as dead in me as though it had never
been.</p>

<p>We went on in silence after that. I had my
bitter draught to swallow, and swallow it I did
without flinching, for all pretty euphemism had
been stripped away.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said at last, “I hope that in
time you will pardon me. And I thank you from
the bottom of my heart that you had the courage
to speak as you did just now. It was the only way
to open my eyes to my real self. Believe me, I
shall be brave enough to look at it steadily.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a quick gesture.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will,” she said very softly.
“And let me tell you one thing more: I shall
always be a better woman for having known you.”</p>

<p>Again I kissed her hand,—humbly as a slave
might,—and again we went on in silence. The
moon rose and threw our shadows far before us
along the road. We came at last to the rough
and uneven ground I had seen from the hillside
and here we found the way more difficult, for the
road grew narrow and uneven, with high untrimmed
hedges closing it in on either hand and
sometimes even meeting overhead, so that we
seemed to be stumbling forward in a tunnel into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
which no ray of light could penetrate. I aided her
as well as I could, but even then it was disheartening
and exhausting work.</p>

<p>“We must rest,” I said; “we must rest;” and
I led her to a seat in the shadow of the hedge.</p>

<p>“I shall recover in a moment,” she protested.
“We must reach Coulonges to-night. I have set
my heart on it. Remember, we burnt our ships
behind us when we abandoned our provisions.”</p>

<p>“We shall reach Coulonges,” I said confidently.
“At the next house I will inquire the way.”</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, starting to her feet. “Let
us go. I am quite rested.”</p>

<p>She was a few paces ahead of me, and I let
her keep the place for a moment that I might
admire her erect and graceful figure, when suddenly
she shrank back against me with a little cry
of fright.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked. “You are not hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she whispered; “but yonder—creep
forward and look.”</p>

<p>There was a sharp turn in the road and as I
went forward cautiously and looked around it
my heart stood still. For there, not two hundred
yards distant, was encamped a regiment of infantry—the
same perhaps that we had seen pass that
afternoon. I contemplated the camp in silence for
a moment, noting how it lay in the little valley,
then I drew back and rejoined my comrade.</p>

<p>“There is no danger,” I said. “We must make
a wide detour and avoid these fellows.”</p>

<p>I searched along the hedge until I found a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
where I could break through, and in a moment we
were together in the field on the other side. Cautiously
we crept away up the hillside until the
lights of the camp gleamed faint behind us; then
we went forward past them. There was no danger
of our being seen, despite the brightness of the
moonlight, for the field was full of sheep—the
same we had seen pass, no doubt—and at a distance,
so low we crept, we could not be distinguished
from them. We came to another hedge
and broke a passage through it, and I was just
turning back toward the road when a low moan
behind me brought me sharp around.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked again, and stretched out
my arms and caught her, or she would have fallen.</p>

<p>“My ankle,” she gasped, her lips white to the
very edge. “I turned it back yonder. I thought
I could walk on it but—oh!” and she shivered
and hid her face against my shoulder.</p>

<p>I placed her gently on the ground and with
trembling fingers undid the laces of her shoe. She
shivered again with agony at my touch and closed
her eyes. I felt that the ankle was already swelling,
and the sweat poured down my face as I
realized what anguish she was in.</p>

<p>“I must get aid,” I said thickly. “I must get
you to some house.”</p>

<p>She was clutching wildly at my sleeve, her face
convulsed, her eyes bright with suffering.</p>

<p>“Leave me,” she said, pulling me down to her.
“Leave me. It is no more than I deserve. Save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
yourself. Only,” she added softly, “kiss me
first.”</p>

<p>For answer, I bent and lifted her tenderly in
my arms, pressed her close against my heart and
kissed her quivering lips, her shining eyes, and
fragrant hair.</p>

<p>“I love you,” I whispered—“more than ever
I love you! Oh, I shall never be able to tell you
how I love you!”</p>

<p>She clung to me desperately, and I held her
close—close—trembling with a great happiness.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I whispered; “I know it now—but
tell me!”</p>

<p>She lifted her face to mine, no longer pinched
with suffering, but radiant with joy.</p>

<p>“I love you!” she said. “Oh, why should I
deny it?”</p>

<p>Again I kissed her; then I set off down the hill,
while she dropped her head upon my shoulder
and sobbed silently—but I knew that it was not
with pain. She was mine—mine! Nothing could
alter that! Not all the oaths of heaven and hell
could alter that! Not the scorn of the living nor
the memory of the dead could alter that! I had
happiness within my hand and I would hold it
fast; there should be no paltering with it, no looking
back, no question of this or that. How foolish
all such questions seemed, now that the die was
cast!</p>

<p>At last I reached the road and for an instant
hesitated, looking up and down. To ask aid of
the Blues would be to court the guillotine, and yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
I might blunder along the road for hours without
coming to a house where help could be secured.
Had I the right to condemn her to that suffering?
Then I remembered Goujon. Better a sprained
ankle than that infamy—better any suffering than
that! And resolutely I set my face westward.</p>

<p>“It will not be long,” I whispered. “We shall
find a house. Be brave! Remember only that I
love you!”</p>

<p>She answered with a pressure of her arms about
my neck, and I went on with new strength, my
heart singing. At last, with a deep breath of
thankfulness, I discerned the roof of a cottage
rising above the hedge to the right. Was it occupied?
There was no light at the window nor
smoke rising from the chimney, but I hastened
forward to its door and knocked. There was no
response. I tried the door and found it barred,
so I knocked again, or rather hammered savagely
with my fist. This time a step approached.</p>

<p>“Be off!” cried a harsh voice. “No entrance
here.”</p>

<p>“Citizen,” I said as mildly as I could, “I ask
your aid—you will lose nothing by opening the
door.”</p>

<p>“Be off!” he cried again. “I will not open.”</p>

<p>“Well then I shall kick it in,” I said, letting
my wrath burst forth, “and shoot you down like
the dog you are. Choose—a gold louis if you aid
me, death if you refuse!” and I gave the door a
premonitory kick which made the flimsy building
tremble. “Come, is it war or peace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“What is it you require, citizen?” asked the
voice after a moment in a milder tone.</p>

<p>“Some water boiling hot and cloth for a
bandage.”</p>

<p>“And for these you will give a gold louis?”</p>

<p>“I promise it.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will open the door.”</p>

<p>“You will make a light first,” I said; and placing
my burden carefully on the ground in the
shadow of the hedge I drew my pistol and assured
myself that it was ready. “Come, make haste,”
I added.</p>

<p>In a moment a light sprang up within and the
door slowly opened. I crossed the threshold with
a bound, to find myself face to face with as villainous
a wretch as I had ever encountered. A
great shock of yellow hair hung over a face so
grimed and crusted with filth that the features
were almost indecipherable. The head hung forward,
and the great hands dangling below the
knees showed that the man was deformed.</p>

<p>“Quick! stir up the fire,” I commanded, “and
heat the water.”</p>

<p>“And the gold louis?” he asked, eyeing my
dress.</p>

<p>I drew it forth and placed it on a rude table
which stood in one corner.</p>

<p>“There it is,” I said; “but it is not yours yet.”</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed as he looked at it and he
licked his lips as a dog might have done at sight
of a savory bone; then he turned to the hearth,
stirred the smoldering embers, threw some pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
of wood upon them, filled an earthenware pot
from another vessel which stood on the hearth,
and placed it in the midst of the flames.</p>

<p>“Your water will be ready in three winks,
citizen,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good!” and I moved before the fire a bench
which served as a chair. “Now I will bring in
my companion.”</p>

<p>“Your companion?” he repeated, looking about
with a snarl.</p>

<p>“Yes—and if you touch the gold-piece I will
kill you. Sit down in yonder corner.”</p>

<p>He backed into the corner indicated and sat
down, staring vacantly. In an instant I was outside,
and lifting my comrade tenderly in my arms,
bore her back into the cottage and closed and
barred the door.</p>

<p>“Sit here, my love,” I said, and placed her on
the bench. “Now, let us see the ankle.”</p>

<p>I knelt before her and with fingers which
trembled so that I could scarcely guide them removed
the shoe and cut away the stocking. The
ankle,—which should have been so slim, so graceful,—was
cruelly swollen.</p>

<p>“It will be better in a moment,” I said, and
dipping the remnant of the stocking into the steaming water,
held it close against the hurt.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is heavenly!” she murmured, and
breathed a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>I bathed the ankle thoroughly, immersing it in
water almost scalding, and every instant I joyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
to see the lines of pain in her face soften and
disappear.</p>

<p>“And now,” I said at last, “we will bandage
it tightly and it will not pain you—only of course
you cannot use it for some days.”</p>

<p>“For some days!” she echoed in dismay. “But
we cannot stay here so long a time.”</p>

<p>“No,” I agreed, “certainly not—but first let
us bandage the ankle.”</p>

<p>But my face fell as I glanced about the room.</p>

<p>“What do you require for a bandage?” she
asked, following my eyes.</p>

<p>“A strip of clean cloth—the longer the better.
But clean cloth in a hovel like this!”</p>

<p>She colored slightly as she looked down at me.</p>

<p>“If you will turn your back for a moment,”
she said, “I think I can supply the bandage.”</p>

<p>I walked over to the corner where our involuntary
host still squatted, cursing softly to himself,
and stood before him. There was a sharp rip.</p>

<p>“How is this, doctor?” asked a voice; and I
turned to see her holding out to me a strip of
linen.</p>

<p>“Excellent!” I cried; and kneeling before her,
I drew it tightly around the ankle. I rejoiced to
see that the swelling had already decreased considerably,
and I bent and kissed the little foot.</p>

<p>“Is that a portion of the treatment?” she asked,
laughing.</p>

<p>“A very necessary portion—don’t you feel the
improvement?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Yes,” she said, her eyes dancing, “I believe
I do.”</p>

<p>“And now,” I added, standing up again, “we
must get out of this. We are still too near that
camp down yonder.”</p>

<p>“But I am such a burden!” she protested.</p>

<p>“A dear, delightful burden;” and I stooped to
raise her. But at that instant a violent blow
sounded on the door.</p>

<p>“Open!” cried a voice. “Open!”</p>

<p>There was no time to temporize; besides, I
knew that to hesitate would be to double any suspicion
we might awaken.</p>

<p>“At once!” I answered. “Be brave, my
love!” I whispered, and kissed her lips. As I
turned away I saw the brute in the corner spring
upon the gold-piece and hide it among his rags.</p>

<p>“Open!” cried the voice again; and the door
shook under a savage blow.</p>

<p>I strode to it and flung it wide.</p>

<p>A flash of arms greeted my eyes, a vision of
fierce faces. In an instant a dozen men came
crowding into the room, and I saw that they wore
the uniform of the Republic.</p>

<span class="small">THE DRAGON’S DEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rush of the intruders, sudden and overwhelming,
drove me back from the door, but I
managed to hold my place, pistol in hand, before
my love, too dazed for the moment to do aught
but stare at them and curse the fortune which had
brought us to this desperate pass. But I had a
part to play,—a part I had rehearsed more than
once for an emergency just such as this,—and I
got my wits back by a supreme effort, while the
newcomers still stood gaping in a semicircle
about us.</p>

<p>“Well, citizens,” I said, trying to achieve a
smile, “one would have thought you were taking
a fortress by assault.”</p>

<p>“We were set to patrol this road,” explained
one of them. “We saw this light and determined
to find out what was going forward here.”</p>

<p>I saw by their awkwardness and want of discipline
that they were not trained soldiery, but raw
levies with no clear idea of their duties; and my
spirits rose.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” I commended, smiling this time
in earnest. “I suspected as much. That is why
I opened so promptly, since we have nothing to
conceal. There is no enemy of the Republic here—only
this honest old fellow, this woman and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
myself. So farewell, my friends. Oblige me by
using this to drink the health of the Nation;”
and I tossed their spokesman a silver crown.</p>

<p>A murmur of satisfaction ran around the group,
and such is the power of self-assurance, that three
or four of them made a motion to withdraw. But
their spokesman, evidently the most intelligent
among them, lingered.</p>

<p>“I fear we must require some account of you,
citizen,” he said, looking at me apologetically,
“and above all of your companion, who appears
to me to be an aristocrat.”</p>

<p>“An aristocrat!” I laughed, realizing in a
flash that in these circumstances I must take some
other line than that I had originally resolved on.
“So it seems you cannot tell maid from mistress!
She is so little of an aristocrat that she hopes to
be <i>vivandière</i> to the regiment which I join.”</p>

<p>“Then, <i>pardieu</i>, you must join ours!” cried
one of the rogues, and pressed toward her. “Hey,
my dear, look at us—we’re a likely set of fellows.
We’ll be kind to you—we’ll do our best to make
you happy;” at which his comrades laughed
approvingly and gazed at my companion with
meaning glances.</p>

<p>“We are already pledged to a regiment at
Thouars, citizen,” I protested, pushing him back
good-naturedly, though there was red murder in
my heart.</p>

<p>“Her clothing is not that of a servant,” said
another, staring at her.</p>

<p>“Well, may not a maid don her mistress’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
gown?” I demanded. “Especially when she is
leaving her for the last time?”</p>

<p>They laughed again at that, but I saw that suspicion
had been aroused—faint indeed, but enough
to imperil us. Any but these country louts would
have seen through the lie at once—that peerless
creature a servant, indeed!</p>

<p>“What is your business here, citizen?” queried
the first speaker after a moment’s silence during
which I noted with uneasiness that none of them
made any movement to retire.</p>

<p>“We stopped here to rest,” I explained. “My
comrade has injured her ankle. We will spend
the night here, since it is impossible for her to go
farther. Your regiment passes here?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, since it also goes to Thouars.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will join it as it passes. Perhaps
you will give us breakfast and permit my comrade
to ride in one of the wagons.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, citizen,” chimed in another with
a laugh; “but we’ll not permit any such scarecrow
as you to ride with her. You’d prefer a handsome
soldier, wouldn’t you, my dear?”</p>

<p>“As you will,” I agreed, laughing too, though
with no small effort; “but you see how pale she
is—she suffers greatly. A night’s rest will change
all that. So good-night, citizens; till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>This time they appeared really satisfied and
started for the door in a body. But a sudden
uproar from without stopped them.</p>

<p>“Name of a dog!” yelled a hoarse voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
“Where are those blockheads? Ah, they shall
hang for this! Deserters! Traitors!”</p>

<p>There was an uneasy movement among the men.
I saw that they had reason to know and fear that
voice. In another instant a ferocious face appeared
in the doorway, its eyes gleaming with rage.</p>

<p>“What!” it cried; and I saw a sword gleam in
the air and descend with no uncertain force on
heads and shoulders. “Dallying here with a light-o’-love!
Is it thus you do your duty? Is it thus
you serve the Nation? Hounds! Curs! I’ll
show you!” and he drove them forth pell-mell into
the road. “And who are you, citizen?” he demanded,
wheeling upon me when the last of them
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“I am on my way to join the army at Thouars,”
I said.</p>

<p>“And she?” and he jerked his thumb toward
my companion.</p>

<p>“Spoil of war,” I explained with a wide smile,
seeing he was too wise to swallow the other story.</p>

<p>He turned and stared at her for a moment.</p>

<p>“My word, you have a pretty taste, citizen,”
he said; and his eye gleamed lasciviously. “I
think I will release you, my dear, from this dirty
brute,” he added to her with a leer he no doubt
thought engaging. “You’d rather have a brave
fellow like myself, wouldn’t you? Say, wouldn’t
you?” and he approached and tweaked her ear.
“Of course you would! So it is settled.”</p>

<p>“Citizen,” I interposed, “I shall have a word
to say to that. She belongs to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>He turned upon me a disdainful countenance.</p>

<p>“Get out, you beast!” he said. “Don’t you
see we wish to be relieved of you? You say you
are going to Thouars. Well, the door is open.
Suppose you start now.”</p>

<p>“When I start my prisoner goes with me,” I
said.</p>

<p>He stared at me for a moment as though scarcely
able to believe his ears.</p>

<p>“What!” he shouted. “You dispute with me!
You—you scum! You insect! You toad! I tell
you to get out! I advise you to get out while
you are able to use your legs.”</p>

<p>“Pah!” I retorted, rage mastering me. “Save
your ass’s voice for those cowards out yonder.
I’m not afraid of noise!”</p>

<p>“Dog!” he yelled, and sprang upon me.</p>

<p>But I had my pistol out—it was his life or
mine—and fired straight into that savage countenance.
I saw the gaping hole the bullet left; I
saw the blood spurt from it as he pitched forward
at my feet. Then a score of savage hands seized
me, and I thought for an instant that I should be
torn asunder. But a mounted patrol, summoned
by the shot, cantered up, cut their way through the
crowd, and jerked me out of its clutches.</p>

<p>“What is all this?” demanded their officer.</p>

<p>In two words they told him the story, pointing
to the body on the floor and to the girl cowering
in one corner, her hands before her face. They
ended by demanding that I be hanged forthwith.</p>

<p>“Oh, he shall hang!” my new captor assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
them. “Rest content. But he may be a spy; and
first we’ll see what he knows. Tie his hands.”</p>

<p>They were secured behind my back in a
twinkling.</p>

<p>“Bring the woman too,” he said; and one of
them brought her forth and threw her across a
horse. I saw with a sigh of relief that she had
fainted. “Give me your rope, Couthon,” he
added to one of his men.</p>

<p>The rope was a strong yet slender line. Already
in one end of it there was a running noose, and I
shuddered as I guessed its meaning. He threw
the noose over my head, drew it tight about my
neck and made the other end fast to a ring in his
saddle.</p>

<p>“Release him,” he commanded, with an evil
laugh. “He can’t get away. Forward!”</p>

<p>For an instant the thought flashed through my
brain that I would end it here, that I would let
myself be dragged under the hoofs of the horses.
Then, as a trooper cantered by me bearing a limp
form before him, I realized my cowardice. So
long as a breath of life remained I must fight to
save her from the hideous fate which threatened
her.</p>

<p>So I ran along in the dust beside my captor in
such an agony of rage and despair as I had never
known. If a wish of mine could have engulfed the
world in ruin I would instantly have uttered it.
I prayed for an earthquake to swallow us, for a
thunderbolt to blast us. I looked up at the clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
sky and cursed it. So this was the end—for me,
death by the rope—for her....</p>

<p>The lights of the camp gleamed ahead. In a
moment we passed the outpost and approached a
tent before which a sentry was stationed.</p>

<p>“Announce to Citizen Goujon,” said my captor,
reining in his horse, “that we have here two
traitors to be judged.”</p>

<p>The sentry saluted and disappeared into the
tent. As for me, my heart had stopped at the
mention of that name. Goujon! Was he to
prove my murderer, too? And Charlotte——</p>

<p>“Enter, citizen,” said the sentry, holding back
the flap of the tent.</p>

<p>My captor threw himself from the saddle and
led me into the tent, the rope still about my neck.
Another followed carrying Charlotte.</p>

<p>Within the tent was a table upon which two
candles gleamed. Before it sat a man examining
a pile of papers. He looked up as we entered,
and I shuddered as I met his eyes; for they seemed
a snake’s eyes, so veiled and cold and venomous
they were. The face was pock-marked, clammy-grey,
and the nose so fissured and swollen that it
had the appearance of a sponge.</p>

<p>He glanced from me to the burden which the
trooper bore, and a slow flush crept into his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked, sharply, turning back to
my captor.</p>

<p>And again I had the pleasure of listening to
the highly-colored story of my recent exploit. I
was a murderer, a traitor—undoubtedly an aristocrat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
I had shot down in cold blood the officer
who was interrogating me. I was plainly a desperate
character and should be hanged before I
had further opportunity for evil.</p>

<p>“But before hanging him,” my captor concluded,
“I thought it best to bring him to you
for interrogation. He may be a spy.”</p>

<p>Goujon nodded.</p>

<p>“You were right,” he said. “Receive my compliments.
Tie him to that pole yonder. As for
the woman, place her on my cot,—we shall find
means to revive her;” and he laughed menacingly.
“You may retire,” he added, “but stay within
call.”</p>

<p>They saluted and withdrew.</p>

<p>Goujon waited until the flap fell behind them.
Then he approached me slowly, until he was quite
near, and contemplated me with those snake’s eyes
of his—my face, my clothes, my shoes. With a
little smile of enjoyment he turned away and bent
above the cot, his hands clasped behind him. At
last he turned to the table, took up a candle and
held the flame close to her lips. It flickered back
and forth, and he set it down again with a chuckle
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then he came back to me and stood for a
moment gloating over me.</p>

<p>“So, Citizen Tavernay,” he said at last with an
infernal smile, “you did not escape after all!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<span class="small">IN THE SHADOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">So</span>, Citizen Tavernay,” he repeated, dwelling
on the words with a malicious triumph, “you did
not escape after all—you and yonder pretty aristocrat.
God’s blood! but this is a pleasant
moment!”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked into my eyes, then burst
into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“For me, I mean!” he cried, holding his sides.
“For me—not for you. Come—look at it from
my standpoint. Be large-minded enough to look
at it from my standpoint. Could anything have
been more perfect, more complete, more admirable
in every way? It tempts me almost to believe in
Providence.”</p>

<p>I could only stand and stare at him and wonder
numbly whether he were man or devil.</p>

<p>“You wonder how I know you?” he continued.
“True, I have never before had the supreme pleasure
of meeting you thus, face to face, and of conversing
pleasantly with you as I am now doing;
but I know you perfectly nevertheless. The
Nation has a sharp eye for its enemies, and it
never sleeps. That eye has been upon you from
the moment of your flight.”</p>

<p>But I had shaken off my stupor and got something
of my boldness back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“Nonsense!” I said contemptuously. “I am
not fleeing. I am on my way to join the forces
at Thouars. You mistake me for some one else.”</p>

<p>He looked at me and nodded, while his smile
grew and broadened.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” he commended; “but it is useless
to lie. Even if you were not Tavernay, your fate
is none the less assured. I can well understand
your reluctance to part with life;” and he cast a
leering glance toward the still form on the cot.
“You must have found life very pleasant recently.
But do not despond. You are leaving your
mistress in tender hands. She will not want for
affection.”</p>

<p>“What is the charge against me?” I demanded,
controlling as well as I could the wrath which
devoured me.</p>

<p>“The charge?” he repeated negligently. “Oh,
I do not know—there are a dozen charges. I have
not yet determined which I shall use. But what
does it matter? Between ourselves, I will tell you,
citizen, that I have decided upon your death
because you are in the way;” and again his eyes
wandered to that still figure.</p>

<p>“You would, then,” I said, realizing that I
must keep my calmness, “murder a patriot in
order to be more free to wrong a woman?”</p>

<p>“A patriot?” he sneered. “Perhaps not—but
I would murder an aristocrat for far less cause
than that.”</p>

<p>“I am not an aristocrat,” I protested desperately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“So you persist in that farce?” he queried coldly.
“Really, you grow wearisome. Perhaps you will
explain then how you happen to be wearing the
clothing of that traitor, Pasdeloup?”</p>

<p>My tongue refused to answer, and he laughed
again as he noted my confusion.</p>

<p>“I recognize it, every stitch,” he went on evenly;
“every stitch except the shoes. And I even think
I can guess where you got those. More than that,
I can have you identified in a moment. Perhaps
you remember Sergeant Dubosq, whom you encountered
on the road from Tours. I am sure
that he will recall you readily, even in this guise,
for he has an excellent memory. Shall I summon
him?”</p>

<p>I saw that it was useless to persist.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “don’t disturb the
sergeant.”</p>

<p>“You admit then that you are Tavernay?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered boldly; “why not? I have
committed no crime——”</p>

<p>“You have opposed the Nation.”</p>

<p>“In what way? By trying to escape?”</p>

<p>“You have abetted the Nation’s enemies.”</p>

<p>“By accepting their hospitality? That is
childish!”</p>

<p>“You have murdered two patriots,” he went on
inexorably.</p>

<p>“Two?” I repeated with a start.</p>

<p>“One you stabbed last night.”</p>

<p>“It was his life or mine.”</p>

<p>“The other you shot a few moments ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“To defend a woman’s honor.”</p>

<p>A sudden light blazed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You pretend it still exists?” he sneered.</p>

<p>I gave him a look, which, had looks that power,
would have scorched and shrivelled him where he
stood. But instead of shrinking he came very close
to me and stared into my eyes, a fiendish grin upon
his lips.</p>

<p>“Really, Citizen Tavernay,” he said at last, “it
would appear from your countenance that this surprising
thing is true; and yet I can scarcely believe
it. Have you taken a vow? Are you—but no
matter. I thank you, my friend, for your forbearance.
I applaud your virtue, which is really
unique even in this age of virtue. Nevertheless
you must agree with me that your death is more
than ever necessary. Indeed I find you already
one too many!” and he glanced toward the cot
with a meaning unmistakable.</p>

<p>“What a brute!” I murmured, contempt mastering
every other emotion. “What a brute!
This is your whole life, then! You think of
nothing but vileness. I might have guessed as
much by looking at you! But one victim has
already escaped you——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he broke in, his face suddenly contorted
with rage; “and the wretch who fired that shot
is burning in hell for it!”</p>

<p>“She died in her husband’s arms,” I continued,
seeing how the words stung him, “happy, his lips
on hers. Of you she had never so much as heard
the name. During her whole life not once did she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
so much as think of you. For her you have never
existed—never will exist! She has escaped you!”</p>

<p>“Go on!” he said hoarsely, licking his lips with
a purple tongue. “Body of God! Go on!”</p>

<p>His face was convulsed with anguish, great
drops of sweat stood out across his forehead; he
was quivering under the blows I dealt him, and yet
he seemed to get a kind of fearful pleasure from
them. And in that instant I saw how he had been
consumed by a hopeless passion; how he had
beaten himself against a lofty wall which he could
never hope to scale; how he was at this moment
eating his heart out—and I might have found it
in my soul to pity him, if I had not so loathed
and hated him for the evil it was still in his power
to do.</p>

<p>“Go on!” he repeated savagely. “What
more?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more,” I answered, “except that your
second victim will escape you even as the other.
God protects His angels!”</p>

<p>“Pah!” he yelled, his wrath bursting forth like
a whirlwind. “I will show you how He protects
them;” and he sprang toward the cot like a wild
beast.</p>

<p>A blind fury seized me—a fury maddening,
uncontrollable. I saw red—literally and actually
I saw red, as though the world had been suddenly
drenched with blood. I strained at the cord about
my wrists until it cut deep into the flesh; I hurled
myself toward him, only to be jerked back cruelly
by the noose about my neck. I cursed him till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
I could curse no longer; I offered my soul’s hope
of eternity for a single moment’s freedom.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I realized my impotence; a great
calm fell upon me. I stopped and looked at him.
He had left the cot and come back to me, bringing
a candle with him in order to see more clearly, and
he stood there regarding me with the air of a
connoisseur.</p>

<p>“Well, citizen,” he asked with a diabolical smile,
“have you finished? If you care to begin again,
pray do so, for it is very amusing. If not, I fear
I shall have to bid you adieu. After all, one must
prosecute his loves in private.”</p>

<p>A long sigh from the cot interrupted him; he
turned with a start, holding the candle above his
head. In an instant I saw my chance; I drew
up my leg and kicked him savagely with all my
strength, full in the belly.</p>

<p>He went back and down with one terrible yell
and lay writhing upon the floor. Again I tore
wildly at my bonds, but the flap of the tent was
dashed aside, and the guard rushed in.</p>

<p>Goujon sat upright with an effort, swaying
from side to side.</p>

<p>“String him up!” he yelled, his lips white with
froth like a mad dog’s. “Hang him! Out with
him this instant! An aristocrat and a traitor!”
The words rose to a scream of agony. “Oh, he
has killed me!” he groaned, and fell forward upon
his face.</p>

<p>“God grant it!” I murmured. “Oh, God grant
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Already their hands were upon me, dragging
me away.</p>

<p>“Tavernay!” screamed a voice. “Tavernay!
Oh, my love!” and I turned my head to see
Charlotte starting from the cot, her hands
outstretched.</p>

<p>For an instant I shook them off; then they closed
about me and hurled me from the tent. I fancied
that death was upon me then and there, so merciless
were the blows they dealt me. By some
miracle I managed to keep my feet, and suddenly
a gigantic figure drove itself through the crowd
like a catapult.</p>

<p>“Murderers!” he shrieked. “Assassins!” and
I heard the blows which sent them to right and
left. “What!” he continued, taking his stand
before me. “You would kill a defenseless man—twenty
against one! What sort of cowards are
you?”</p>

<p>“He is an aristocrat,” broke in the man who
held my halter. “Citizen Goujon has ordered
that he be hanged.”</p>

<p>“Hang him and welcome,” rejoined the newcomer;
“but don’t let me catch you worrying him
like dogs. Now off with you!”</p>

<p>The voice sounded strangely familiar in my
ears, and when I had shaken the blood from my
eyes, I saw that my rescuer was Dubosq.</p>

<p>“Many thanks, my friend,” I said; and he
started round astonished. “It seems you do not
know me,” I added, as he stared his bewilderment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
“and yet it was only three days ago that we met
on the road from Tours.”</p>

<p>He seized a torch from the hand of a bystander
and flashed it into my face.</p>

<p>“My word, citizen!” he cried. “Small wonder!
You looked like a bridegroom, then—and now—
What have you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p>“I have been trying to escape being murdered,”
I rejoined. “And it seems that I am not going
to escape after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will,” he corrected; “you shall
not be murdered, I will see to that—only prettily
executed.”</p>

<p>“There is a difference, then?” I questioned,
with irony.</p>

<p>“All the difference in the world,” he answered
with conviction. “The one is irregular and apt
to be bungled; it is done without authority and
without method, and is often needlessly prolonged.
The other is carefully planned and quickly carried
out; all unpleasantness is avoided——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is!” I broke in with a little laugh. “I
am glad to know that!”</p>

<p>“Citizen, you surprise me!” protested Dubosq;
and I saw that he was in earnest. “I thought you
more of a philosopher. Since this is the end, why
worry about it?”</p>

<p>“I will try not to,” I said; “but at twenty-one
the end comes rather early.”</p>

<p>“True,” he agreed, and gazed at me contemplatively;
“I had forgot that you were so young.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, I thank you for your interest,”
I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Perhaps it is misplaced;” and he looked at me,
frowning heavily. “So you were an accomplice
of the <i>ci-devant</i> Favras, after all. You lied very
prettily that morning, citizen—and I would have
sworn that you were fresh from the nursery.
That’s one on old Dubosq.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” I protested. “I did not
lie—I had never seen Favras before. He took
my horse by force, as I related to you; but I found
him awaiting me at the next town. He restored
my horse to me and insisted that I spend the night
at his château.”</p>

<p>“Faith, citizen,” said Dubosq with a laugh,
“you’d better have lost your horse and spent the
night under a hedge. As it is, you lose your life
and enter the eternal night.”</p>

<p>“Yes; there’s no help for that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not if Citizen Goujon has ordered it.”</p>

<p>“He did order it,” broke in one of my persecutors,
who had listened to all this with ill-concealed
impatience, “and at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, comrade,” said Dubosq; “come
along, then. But he didn’t order you to torture
this fellow, and, <i>pardieu</i>, I’ll see that you don’t.
If you have any message, Citizen—I’ve forgotten
your name.”</p>

<p>“Tavernay,” I prompted.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I remember. Well, if you have any
messages, Citizen Tavernay, I’ll be glad to take
charge of them. It’s the only kindness I can do
you, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my friend,” I answered, tears in my
eyes at this unexpected favor. “If you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
convey news of my death to my mother at Beaufort——”</p>

<p>“Consider it done,” he broke in. “Anything
else?”</p>

<p>“Citizen,” I said, lowering my voice, “for
myself I do not greatly care. But I had a companion—a
pure and beautiful woman. If you can
save her from death, or worse, you will be doing
a noble action.”</p>

<p>Dubosq pulled his great mustaches thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Is she an aristocrat?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I hastened to assure him. “She
was merely a guest at the château like myself.”</p>

<p>“I will see what can be done,” he promised;
“but it will be no easy task.”</p>

<p>“I know it, my friend; therefore I ask it of
you.”</p>

<p>“Come, Citizen Tavernay,” he said, raising his
head suddenly, “I can pledge you one thing.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“That she has nothing worse to fear than
death.”</p>

<p>“God bless you!” I said with trembling lips.
“God bless you! Now I can die in peace.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, citizen,” said Dubosq in a
voice almost tender, “I regret more and more
that you did not accept my invitation to join us
that morning, for, by my soul, you are a gallant
fellow!”</p>

<p>We had reached a small oak which grew upon
the hillside, and one end of the line was thrown
over a lower branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“One minute to shrive yourself, citizen,” called
a rude voice.</p>

<p>I looked out over the hillside. The moon was
sailing high in the heavens, and I noticed that
the flock of sheep was moving down toward us.
Just above us was the line of sentinels, and the
fires of the camp gleamed along the road below.
I could see the soldiers crowded about them, for
the night was chill; could hear their jests and
laughter. The tragedy which was enacting here
on the hillside, and which meant so much to me,
concerned them not at all. They would go their
way, the world would wag along, only I would no
longer be a part of it. My mother—this would
be her death, too—the death of all her hopes, all
her ambitions. She would have nothing more to
live for. I wondered what she was doing at this
moment. Did some message of the spirit warn
her that her only son was in deadly peril? Another
woman would miss me—but aside from these my
disappearance would be scarce noted. It would
create not even a ripple on the great ocean of the
world. My life would count for nothing.</p>

<p>I thought of all this, and more, which I cannot
set down here—and commended my soul to God.
So this was the end! How little I had foreseen it
when I had ridden so bravely out from Beaufort!
How deeply I had lived in those three days! They
seemed to count more than all the rest of my
life——</p>

<p>“The time is up, citizen!” called the same rude
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Dubosq was at my side.</p>

<p>“Courage!” he whispered. “It is soon over!”</p>

<p>“Adieu, my friend,” I said. “Remember your
promise.”</p>

<p>“I do remember it. Trust me.”</p>

<p>I raised my head. At least I would die worthily.</p>

<p>“God and the King!” I shouted. “Death to
the Na——”</p>

<p>There came a sharp pain at my throat——</p>

<p>Then, as though I had uttered a signal, a hundred
muskets crashed from the hedge at our right.
The rope relaxed; I opened my eyes to see with
astonishment the sheep rising on two legs and
charging down upon us. The night was filled with
shrill cries, with hideous yells. In the camp a
drum was beating, and I could see the Blues
running to arm themselves, dashing hither and
thither in panic, their officers straining to bring
order to the frenzied mob. But the savage flood
was upon us....</p>

<p>“At least, aristocrat, you shall not escape!”
hissed a voice in my ear; and the world reeled and
turned black before me as a great blow fell upon
my head.</p>

<span class="small">“COURAGE!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a time I thought I was again in that raftered
chamber at Beaufort which had been mine for so
many years; but finally I recognized uneasily that
this was not the bed to which I was accustomed,
nor were these dark and grimy walls the ones at
which I had been wont to stare while building my
castles in Spain.</p>

<p>Then in a flash I remembered,—escape, flight,
capture, rescue,—and I started to spring from the
bed, but fell back again with a cry of pain. For
an instant my head seemed splitting open, and I
closed my eyes dizzily.</p>

<p>“Gently, monsieur, gently,” said a voice; and
I opened my eyes to see a kindly woman’s face
bending over me. “You must lie still,” she added,
and placed a cool hand upon my forehead. “You
must go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“But where am I?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You are with friends.”</p>

<p>“And Mademoiselle de Chambray?”</p>

<p>“She also is safe.”</p>

<p>I closed my eyes with a deep sigh of thankfulness.
Safe, safe, safe—I repeated the word to
myself again and again. Safe! Surely Providence
had guarded us! Safe....</p>

<p>When I awoke the second time it was night, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
I lay for long staring up through the darkness
and piecing together the adventures which had
befallen me since that moment when Dubosq had
halted me on the highway from Tours. My heart
quickened as I recalled that evening in the garden,
as I rebuilt it, as I lived it over again, second by
second. Ah, that had been the one hour of my
life! And yet, even in the shadow of the perils
which followed, I had not been unhappy, for she
had been beside me, with her clear eyes and smiling
lips; and if she chose to smite me now and then,
why certainly I had invited the blows and even,
in a way, deserved them.</p>

<p>Then at the end I had won. That final disaster
had driven her straight into my arms, as a storm
drives the boats to harbor. She had laid her
head upon my shoulder and whispered that she
loved me! My pulses quickened at thought of it.
She loved me—that superb, matchless woman loved
me! What did all the rest matter—the world’s
opinion, my plighted word? I would take her—I
would never give her up! She loved me! That
should be my justification. And gripping that
thought tight against my heart I dropped away to
sleep.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly at the open window
when I awakened for the third time, and again I
saw that kindly face bending above me.</p>

<p>“You are better, monsieur?” she asked; and
again her cool hand touched my forehead. “Yes—your
fever is nearly gone.”</p>

<p>“I am quite well,” I assured her, “except for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
little soreness of the head. Where are my
clothes?”</p>

<p>“You will not need them for some days yet,”
she said, smiling at my eagerness.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” I protested. “I must get up at
once;” and I made a movement to throw back
the covers, but she held my hands, and I found
with surprise that she was stronger than I.</p>

<p>“You see,” she added, still smiling, “you are
weaker than you thought.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot lie here,” I cried half angrily.
“I must get up. I have many things to do.”</p>

<p>I shrank somehow from asking her outright
where my love was waiting, why she did not come
to me. Perhaps she was ill and could not come.
That injury to the ankle....</p>

<p>“I must get up,” I repeated doggedly; but again
she held me back, her kindly eyes reading the
trouble in my face.</p>

<p>“If you will lie still,” she said, “I will bring
you some one who will tell you all you wish to
know—and whom, besides, I think you will be
very glad to see.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I answered, my heart beating
madly. “At once?”</p>

<p>She nodded, went to the door and spoke a word
to some one in the room beyond.</p>

<p>Then my heart chilled, for it was not the dear
face I had hoped to see which appeared in answer
to the summons, but an ugly, bearded countenance,
set on gigantic shoulders. And yet, at a second
glance, I saw that the countenance, though ugly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
was not repulsive, that the eyes were kindly, and
that the lips could smile winningly.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay,” said my nurse, bringing
him to my bedside, “this is M. de Marigny.”</p>

<p>He bent and pressed one of my hands in his
great palm, then sat down beside me, while I gazed
with interest at perhaps the most famous among
the leaders of the Bocage.</p>

<p>“And very pleased I am to find you doing so
well, monsieur,” he said in a voice singularly rich.
“In faith, I thought for a time that we had rescued
you from the rope merely to condemn you to the
bludgeon.”</p>

<p>“Even that would have been a service, monsieur,”
I answered, smiling in response to him.
“But it seems I am to get well again.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you had youth and health to fight for
you. Alas, they are not always on one’s side!”</p>

<p>“But the rescue, monsieur?” I asked. “How
came it so pat to the moment?”</p>

<p>“I must confess that that was an accident,” he
laughed. “My spies brought me word that this
regiment was marching to Thouars. I determined
to strike one more blow before Easter, so I called
my men together and we waited behind our hedges.
When night fell we turned our sheepskins and,
mingling with the flock upon the hillside, gradually
descended upon our enemy’s pickets. It was then
that a sudden commotion in the camp below
attracted our attention. We saw a fracas, from
which emerged that little procession of which you
were the central figure. We saw them prepare for
the execution and supposing them to be about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
hang some cut-throat of their own waited until
they should accomplish it. Then suddenly you
gave our battle-cry, ‘God and the King!’ and
brought us headlong to your rescue. In fact I
had not even to give the word to fire.”</p>

<p>“It was fortunate I chose to make a theatric
exit,” I commented, laughing.</p>

<p>“Permit me to say that it was the act of a brave
man, monsieur. I trust that I shall meet my end
as bravely.”</p>

<p>Poor, gallant gentleman! He met it more
bravely still—the victim of treacherous envy, he
faced the muskets erect, with eyes unbandaged,
and himself gave the word to fire.</p>

<p>“Tell me more,” I urged. “You won?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; we cut them to pieces and seized a
store of arms and ammunition which will stand us
in good stead. But we captured something else a
thousand times more welcome.”</p>

<p>“What was that, monsieur?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That was Citizen Goujon,” he answered; and
his eyes grew cold as steel. “We found him
writhing in his tent——”</p>

<p>“Yes—I planted one good blow,” I said, and
told him the story. “What did you do with
him?”</p>

<p>“We dragged him out, screaming with terror,
begging for mercy, offering to divulge I know not
what secrets, and hanged him with the rope which
had been prepared for you. It was a pretty vengeance—even
you could not desire a better.”</p>

<p>“No,” I murmured. “No.”</p>

<p>His face softened into a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“It has a resemblance to a certain Bible story,
hasn’t it?” he asked. “I did not then know the
full tale of Goujon’s iniquities, or I might have
chosen a different death for him. It was Mademoiselle
de Chambray who told me of the assault
upon the château and the death of my dear friend,
de Favras. Permit me to say that in that affair
also, M. de Tavernay, you proved yourself a
gallant man.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, monsieur,” I answered. “I but
did what any gentleman would do. You found
Mademoiselle de Chambray, then?”</p>

<p>I tried to ask it carelessly, but I fear my burning
face betrayed me. At any rate, he smiled
again as he looked at me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “we found her lying senseless
on the floor of Goujon’s tent. At first we thought
her dead, but she soon opened her eyes. Can you
guess what her first word was? But perhaps I
ought not to tell you!”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I murmured, striving to restrain the
leaping of my heart.</p>

<p>“Well, you deserve some reward. Her first
word was ‘Tavernay!’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, my eyes suddenly misty; “she
had just seen me dragged away to be hanged.”</p>

<p>“And when we told her what had befallen you
she ran to where you lay——”</p>

<p>“But her ankle,” I broke in. “Did you
know——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she had forgotten it. She ran to
where you lay; she washed and dressed your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
wound; she had you borne hither on a litter; and
she remained beside you until yesterday—until,
in a word, it was certain that you would recover.”</p>

<p>“Then she has gone?” I asked. “She has
gone?” and my heart seemed to stop in my bosom.</p>

<p>“Yes, she has gone.”</p>

<p>“But her ankle?” I protested. “Oh, how she
must have suffered!”</p>

<p>“She did not suffer at all,” said Marigny.
“When she at last had time to remember her
injury she found that it no longer existed. She
attributed its cure to you.”</p>

<p>I lay a moment silent, striving to appear composed.
She had gone—she had been brave enough
to go; she had sought to spare me the agony of
that farewell which must in any event be spoken.
She had been wise perhaps. She knew my weakness;
but I felt that I would give my whole life
to see her again, to hold her hand, to look into
her eyes, to hear her say once more, “I love you!”</p>

<p>“She left no word for me?” I asked at last.</p>

<p>“She left a note; but I am not to give it to you
until you are ready to set out for Poitiers.”</p>

<p>“For Poitiers?” I repeated, trembling. “Did
she herself name Poitiers?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly. And why do you grow so
pale, my friend? Is it not near Poitiers that her
home is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur,” I groaned; “but my journey
ends two leagues this side of Chambray. Those
two leagues I shall never cover.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! Take my advice, the advice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
of a man who knows more than you of women.
Do not draw rein at Poitiers. Press on to the end
of the journey. You will find a fair prize awaiting
you.”</p>

<p>I shook my head—he may have known other
women, but not this one.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I should like to have the note,
M. de Marigny,” I said. “It will comfort me
somewhat. And besides, I am to start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” he cried. “A week hence perhaps,
if all goes well.”</p>

<p>I smiled and continued to hold out my hand.</p>

<p>“Let me have the note, monsieur,” I repeated.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, still looking at me, then
went to the other room and brought the note back
with him and placed it in my hands.</p>

<p>My fingers were trembling so I could scarcely
break the seal; a mad hope possessed me that she
had absolved me from my vow, that she summoned
me to her. As I opened the paper a little
heap of withered rose leaves fell upon my breast.</p>

<p>“Ah, you see!” cried Marigny. “I was right,
then!”</p>

<p>I could not answer, but I held out the note for
him to read. It contained but one word:
“Courage!”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “that is good advice. That
is precisely what you need in this affair, M. de
Tavernay.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed bitterly; “courage to give her
up—courage never again to see her. You see
she has gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“She could not very well remain,” he said dryly,
“after listening to you three days in your
delirium!”</p>

<p>“My delirium?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say she was not offended—what
woman would have been?—but she was certainly
red to the ears most of the time. Few maidens,
I fancy, have been treated to such a continuous
stretch of love-making.”</p>

<p>I reddened, too, at thought of it.</p>

<p>“What she has suffered on my account!” I
murmured.</p>

<p>“I tell you she did not suffer in the least,”
repeated Marigny. “You permitted her to see to
the very bottom of your soul, and she saw no
image there except her own!”</p>

<p>“She knew that from the first,” I said sadly;
“that does not alter matters. No; there is no
way out, M. de Marigny. I can never hope to
marry her—honor forbids it—an oath not to be
broken. She herself has pointed that out to me
in the clearest way. She has shown me what a
coward I was when, for a moment, I permitted
my love for her to blind me to my duty; and I
know how she hates a coward. That is the real
meaning of this message, monsieur; she is afraid
even yet that I may not be brave enough.”</p>

<p>Marigny had risen and stood looking down at
me with a queer little smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>“Ah, M. de Tavernay,” he said at last, “I
understand now why that blow on the head failed
to kill you.”</p>

<p>With which cryptic utterance he left the room.</p>

<span class="small">THE PATH OF HONOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> dawn two days later I took horse for Poitiers
with clothes and equipage furnished me by M. de
Marigny, who had been exceedingly kind to me
from the first, though delighting to speak in
riddles, from which he seemingly drew vast amusement.
For myself, I was not in vein to be amused.
I had fought my battle, and I had won it; I had
set forward on the path of honor; but the victory
had left a wound still raw and bleeding.</p>

<p>Yet such is the vanity of human nature that it
was not without a certain pride in my achievement
that I bade my host good-by and turned my horse’s
head toward the south. At least I need be ashamed
to look no man or woman in the face. As for
that scar in my heart, no eye except my own
should ever contemplate it.</p>

<p>What a different creature this from that careless,
heart-free boy who had pricked forth from
Beaufort little more than a week before! Since
then I had lived my whole life; I had sprung from
youth to manhood; I had faced death, tasted of
the world, gazed into a woman’s eyes. I had
taken blows and given them; I had walked in the
black depths of despair, and stood transfigured on
the uttermost peaks of joy. Love had touched me
and left me changed. I had lived,—for a week I
had lived,—nothing could take that from me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>After much thought I had formed my plan of
action. It was quite possible, as Mlle. de Chambray
had said, that Mlle. de Benseval desired me
as little as I desired her. In case this were true,—and
I flattered myself that it would require no
great penetration on my part to discern it,—I
would offer her her freedom. Should she refuse it,
should she feel bound by our oath, as I did, I
would marry her, then fling myself into the war
in La Vendée, trusting that some kindly bullet
would release us both from our unhappy fate.
But if, on the contrary, she looked on me with
favor, if I saw that I might win her heart, I would
play a man’s part and be as fond a lover as it is
possible to be by taking thought.</p>

<p>So, having arrived at this conclusion, I put it
behind me for the moment and pricked forward
along the road more cheerfully than I had thought
possible. Such is the virtue of facing one’s duty
squarely, of making up one’s mind—even if it is
only to accept manfully the worst that fate may
offer.</p>

<p>My road at first lay through the narrow valleys
and between the high hedges of the Bocage.
Everywhere the peasants were working in their
fields; their flocks were grazing peacefully in the
pastures, and one would never have suspected that
it was in this quiet country the first effective stand
had been made against the bloody torrent of the
Revolution. At last I passed Airvault and came
out into the more level country of the Plain. I
had planned to reach Neuville by noon, so pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
on at a good pace, secure in the knowledge that
here to the south I should encounter no Republican
force and consequently no delay.</p>

<p>I reached Neuville in good season without
adventure of any kind and asked to be directed
to the Bon Vivant, an inn to which I had been
recommended by M. de Marigny as the only
decent one in the village. I found it without
difficulty and sat down at a table on a little vine-clad
terrace overlooking a pleasant valley. Here
my lunch was presently brought to me, and here,
soon after, the landlord sought me out and leaned
deferentially above my chair.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more monsieur requires?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing; I am thoroughly content,” I
answered. “I have to thank a friend for advising
me to stop here.”</p>

<p>“Have I the honor of addressing M. de Tavernay?”
he questioned, bending still lower.</p>

<p>“That is indeed my name,” I said, glancing
up at him in surprise. “I did not know it had
penetrated to these parts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur is too modest!” he returned
with a flattering smile. “There is a person here
who wishes to speak with monsieur when he is
at leisure.”</p>

<p>“To speak with me?” I repeated, more and
more astonished. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>“I do not know his name, but he is most
anxious not to miss monsieur. He has been awaiting
monsieur since yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>The thought flashed through my mind that it
was some emissary of the Republic sent to arrest
me, but a moment’s reflection showed me the
absurdity of such a suspicion. How should the
Republic know that I would pass this way, that
I would stop at this inn? Besides, I was too
small a bird to trouble the Republic—though,
small as I was, I added to myself with a smile,
the task of arresting me would scarcely have been
entrusted to a single man. No; since he approached
me alone in this manner he could not
be an enemy. A sudden trembling seized me.
Perhaps——</p>

<p>“Bring him here at once,” I said; and my host,
who had been patiently awaiting the end of my
perplexity, bowed and hurried away.</p>

<p>He reappeared in a moment followed by a man
dressed decently in black and showing all the
marks of the servant. A glance at his face told
me that I had never before seen him.</p>

<p>“This is M. de Tavernay,” said my host to
him; and bowing again to me, withdrew. Evidently
I had become in his eyes a person of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>“Well?” I asked, as calmly as I could, for my
heart was throbbing wildly as I turned to the newcomer.
“You wished to speak to me?”</p>

<p>“I have a letter for monsieur,” he answered,
and produced it from an inner pocket.</p>

<p>“A letter?” I repeated, and seized it with
trembling hand. Then a sudden chill fell upon
me as I saw the signature. The note ran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Tavernay</span>:—</p>

<p>“My friend M. de Marigny, who seems to have fallen
in love with you, has written me something of the adventures
which have befallen you since you started on your
journey to Poitiers. I need hardly tell you that I have
awaited news from you with the greatest anxiety, and
that I am overjoyed to know that you have come through
so gallantly. I am sending a faithful man to meet you in
order that he may bring you direct to me, for I am longing
to clasp the son of my old friend in my arms. My daughter
joins me in wishes for your speedy arrival.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Louis Marie de Benseval.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>I read it through twice in order to give myself
time to recover from the blow, especially from
the poniard stroke of that final sentence.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said at last. “This was very
thoughtful of your master. Have the horses got
ready and I will join you in a moment.”</p>

<p>He hastened away, and when, having finished
my wine, I descended into the courtyard of the
inn, I found him awaiting me with the horses
accoutred for the journey. I swung into the
saddle and cantered out from the inn, he following
a pace behind.</p>

<p>But my serenity of the morning had vanished
utterly. Now that I was face to face with the
task which awaited me, now that there was no
longer chance of evasion or escape, the blood
turned to water in my veins. To make love to a
woman I did not love, to appear before her always
with a smile upon my lips and soft words upon
my tongue, to play the gallant when my heart was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
far away, to lead her to the church, to be bound
to her irrevocably, and finally to pass the remainder
of my life in her company, always with deceit
in my face—in a word, to live a lie!—that was
the task I had set myself. Would I be able to
accomplish it? Was it not beyond my poor
strength? After all, did honor demand of me
such a sacrifice?</p>

<p>But I put that thought from me for the last time
as I recalled certain scorching words which had
been uttered to me on the road from Dairon. I
must accomplish it, or prove myself unworthy of
that temple in which she had enshrined me! I
put my hand into my bosom and touched the note
I carried there, repeating its one word over and
over to myself:</p>

<p>“Courage! Courage! Courage!”</p>

<p>And in that moment my doubts fell away, never
to return. I was armed, <i>cap-a-pie</i>, against whatever
arrows fate might launch.</p>

<p>At last I turned and motioned my attendant to
come forward.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” I asked, noting his
intelligent face.</p>

<p>“Bertin, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“You left your master in good health, I trust?”</p>

<p>“In excellent health, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“And your mistress?”</p>

<p>“She also, monsieur. I have never seen her
looking better.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” I went on, “Madame de Benseval
is dead, is she not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“Oh, these many years, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“There was only one child?”</p>

<p>“Only one, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“How old is she?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen, monsieur.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to ask him if
she was beautiful, but I choked the question back.
It was indiscreet—and after all what did it matter?</p>

<p>“They have been greatly worried at monsieur’s
failure to appear,” he added.</p>

<p>I almost groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“M. de Benseval said he had been expecting
me,” I murmured mechanically.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; for a week almost. He had made
arrangements for the fête, but of course it was
postponed when monsieur did not arrive.”</p>

<p>“Postponed until when, Bertin?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“It is to take place to-morrow if monsieur
approves,” he answered, and glanced at me quickly.</p>

<p>This time I could not wholly suppress the groan,
but managed to change it into a cough. The end
was nearer than I had thought.</p>

<p>We rode on in silence after that, for I had no
more questions to ask, nor apparently had Bertin
any information to volunteer. And at last, just
as dusk was falling, we trotted around a turn in
the road and saw before us the walls and towers
of Poitiers rising tier upon tier to the cathedral
which crowns the summit of the hill upon which
the town is built. It looked warm and gay in the
rays of the setting sun, but darkness had fallen ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
we crossed the bridge which leads into the town;
and once engulfed in its narrow, steep, and tortuous
streets, I had soon lost all sense of direction,
and appreciated more than ever M. de Benseval’s
thoughtfulness in sending me a guide.</p>

<p>For my companion seemed to know the road
perfectly, turned this way and that without hesitation,
and at last drew rein before a house at
whose door a torch was flaring.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he said, as he threw himself
from the saddle and helped me to dismount.
“This way, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had we set foot on the lowest step
when the door burst open and a man appeared on
the threshold—a man tall, of commanding presence,
with the noblest countenance I had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Tavernay!” he cried, his arms extended.
“Tavernay!”</p>

<p>And I, as though I had found a second father,
sprang up the steps and threw myself into them.</p>

<p>I know not how it was, but at the end of a
moment I was telling myself that it was worth
some sacrifice to be near a man like this. He led
me in across the vestibule to the drawing-room
beyond and sat me down and looked at me.</p>

<p>“You are your father over again, my boy,” he
said at last; and his face was very tender. “I
see already that I am going to love you!”</p>

<p>I could find no word of answer, but I think
he read my heart in my face for he held out his
hand and gripped mine.</p>

<p>“And now,” he continued, “before you meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
my daughter I desire to talk frankly with you for
a moment. I have sometimes wondered if your
father and I were wise to bind you when you
were only a child. After all, a man should choose
for himself, for marriage without love is not marriage,
and good or bad, there is no escape once
the vows are taken. I know the Paris fashion;
I know that there are many fathers who do not
believe as I do; they think me a fool—which is not
so harsh a name as I sometimes apply to them.
Your father was the dearest friend I ever had. I
certainly do not intend to make his son unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” I said, “I am already betrothed
to your daughter. If she does not love
another——”</p>

<p>“No,” he said quickly, “I can answer for that.”</p>

<p>“Then, monsieur, I am ready to espouse her,
and I will do my best to make her happy.”</p>

<p>He gripped my hand again, his eyes very bright.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” he said; “but it is not a
question of her happiness, but of yours. That
she will find you a good and tender husband I do
not doubt; but there are some things which you
should know. She has had no mother for many
years, and I have perhaps been too occupied in my
own affairs to give her the attention she required.
She has to a certain extent gone her own way, and
such training as I have given her has, I fear,
been a man’s training rather than a woman’s. So
she grew up somewhat wild and headstrong, with
strange ideas upon many subjects; though I did
not suspect this until a month ago when I bade her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
prepare her trousseau. It was at that time she
gave evidence of a disposition wholly new to me.
In a word, she begged me that she might not be
compelled to marry, and when I reminded her
that my honor was engaged she retorted that her
happiness weighed more heavily with her than my
honor, and that at least she reserved the right
to see you before consenting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur,” I broke in, “say no more.
I have no wish to force her to become my wife.”</p>

<p>He held up his hand to stop me.</p>

<p>“Understand,” he said, his eyes on mine, “that
I did not agree with her. With women it is not
the same as men. Any man who is affectionate
and faithful can win a woman’s love, and keep it.
She has not a man’s distractions, temptations,
opportunities. I am very sure that you will make
my daughter love you.”</p>

<p>“God grant it,” I said, my lips quivering. “It
is my wish to make her happy. But I am not
a brilliant match—not so brilliant as she deserves.
You are aware that this Revolution has ruined us.”</p>

<p>Again he held up his hand.</p>

<p>“No more of that, M. de Tavernay. By the
way, you have not yet asked me what her dowry
is to be.”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “I had not thought of it.”</p>

<p>He smiled queerly.</p>

<p>“Well, we can settle all that to-morrow,” he
said. “My chief concern is for your happiness.
Tell me frankly, my friend, do you desire this
marriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“A man is bound by his oath, monsieur,” I
answered, trembling a little, but meeting without
flinching the searching gaze he bent upon me.
“Courage! Courage!” my heart repeated.</p>

<p>“I press this point,” he added, “even perhaps
to indiscretion, because M. de Marigny dropped
what I fancied was a hint that you had formed
another attachment.”</p>

<p>I put the past behind me and faced the future
squarely. The moment had come to lie, and I
met it as bravely as I could.</p>

<p>“M. de Marigny was mistaken,” I said steadily.
“Be assured that if your daughter does me the
honor to accept my hand she will find that my
heart goes with it.”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and gripped both my hands
in his.</p>

<p>“Spoken like a man!” he cried, his eyes shining
strangely. “I feel that I have found a son—I
give you my daughter gladly. Come,” he added,
“she awaits you;” and he opened a door and
motioned me to precede him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<span class="small">THE GUERDON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment I did not see her; then I caught
the shimmer of her gown from the embrasure of a
window, where she stood staring absently down
into the street below, and there floated to me a
faint perfume which shook me with the agony of
recollection. I turned blindly, expecting her father
to announce me, but found with astonishment
that he had closed the door and left me alone with
her. A terrible shyness and indecision seized me.
To advance to her boldly, to take her hand—that
was the lover’s part, and yet I felt myself utterly
unable to fulfil it. Ah, what a horrible chance
that she, too, should use that perfume! I had
not reckoned upon that!</p>

<p>“Courage! Courage! Courage!” I repeated
to myself, and touched the note warm against my
heart; but in this supreme crisis, its power failed
me.</p>

<p>So I stood where I was, the cold sweat upon
my brow, looking foolish enough, as I have since
been told, and waited for her to turn and discover
me. That she did not turn surprised me more
and more, for surely she must have heard the
opening and closing of the door. Then, as I saw
her more clearly, I perceived that she, too, was
agitated, for she carried her handkerchief to her
lips once or twice with a hand anything but steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Whatever my cowardice, I could not permit
her to suffer because of it, so I gripped my courage
to me and advanced to her side.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I began stammeringly.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly and faced me—and I stood
struck to stone, staring, not able to believe my
eyes; for it was she—my love—Charlotte!</p>

<p>“You!” I said hoarsely at last. “You!”</p>

<p>The blood was coming and going in her cheeks;
her eyes were luminous with a strange fire. She
held out a trembling hand to me, and when I
kissed it I found it cold as ice.</p>

<p>“Did you think it very heartless of me to
desert you, M. de Tavernay?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“At first I could scarcely believe it,” I stammered,
still staring at her; “but afterwards I saw
that you meant to be kind. I should not have
won the battle if you had stayed.”</p>

<p>“And you did win it!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yes; your note helped—and—and the rose leaves,”
I added hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I found them—in your bosom,” she said, her
color deepening. “I thought—perhaps—you
would like to have them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said; “yes;” then stopped, looking at
her. “But one may lose a battle even after winning
it,” I warned her. “I fear I am losing mine.
You are trusting me too far, as you did once
before. Do you remember?” and my blood
glowed at the recollection.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she said, and turned away.</p>

<p>“Where is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>I hesitated, looking about me. I could not say
the words.</p>

<p>“Your betrothed?” she finished, turning back,
her eyes gleaming in the old manner. “You are
longing for her, then?”</p>

<p>“Without a rock to tie to,” I said as calmly as
I could, “I shall be swept away in another moment,
beyond hope of rescue. I have never seen you so
beautiful. I have never loved you——”</p>

<p>She stopped me with a gesture.</p>

<p>“M. de Tavernay,” she said with impressive
gravity, “it is my painful duty to tell you that
Mlle. de Benseval no longer exists.”</p>

<p>“She is dead!” I murmured dazedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, not in the least. She was never more
thoroughly alive than at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Then she is married!” I cried, a great load
lifting from my heart. “I see it all—she <i>did</i> love
another—she has married him.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again, monsieur. She is still a
maiden and does not love another.”</p>

<p>“Come!” I said. “You are playing with me.
I warn you, it is dangerous!” and I gripped my
arms behind me to keep them from about her.</p>

<p>She noticed the movement and retreated a step.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” she said, “I will tell you the story—if
you will promise to remain where you are
until I have finished.”</p>

<p>“And after you have finished?”</p>

<p>“Oh—then—you may do as you please.”</p>

<p>“I promise!” I cried, the blood bounding
madly through my veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“It seems that your betrothed is a wilful and
headstrong creature,” she began, “and when the
time came to prepare to marry you she rebelled.
She had been permitted to form ideas of her own.
She refused to give herself to a man she had never
seen, or whom she remembered only as a thin and
unattractive boy. So the day before you were to
arrive, having failed to exact from her father the
promise that the right of choice should be left
to her——”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me,” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“But he did not tell you that she fled?”</p>

<p>“Fled!” I repeated. “Then that is the reason
she is not here.”</p>

<p>“I am sure she would never have done it,” my
companion continued; “however irregular her
training—would never perhaps have thought of a
step so desperate, but for a book she happened to
find one day in her father’s library. She was
attracted first by the illustrations, which were by
Gravelot and very beautiful; then she became
absorbed in the story, a translation from the English,
which related the adventures of a young lady
who ran away from her father to avoid a marriage
into which he would have forced her.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The results
of this flight proved so fortunate,—for by it she
won the man she really loved,—that Mlle. de
Benseval resolved to emulate it. So she mounted
her horse one morning and instead of taking her
usual ride, dismissed her groom and spurred away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
to the house of a friend who, she knew, would
sympathize with her and perhaps intercede with
her father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was with him she was in love!” I
murmured.</p>

<p>“Not in the least, monsieur; she was in love
with no one, and this friend was a woman. But
that very evening, strangely enough, she met some
one whom she fancied she might love; and in the
days that followed, when they were much together,
she was drawn very near to him; for she saw that
he loved her truly. And at last, in a moment of
trial when he held her in his arms, she confessed
that she loved him in return.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said with a sigh of relief, “it appears
to me then that I need think no more of Mlle. de
Benseval. Let us dismiss her—there is another
topic——”</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said; “I fear you will find yourself
thinking a great deal about her before long. For
after that one moment of utter joy she drew away
from her lover, held him at a distance, was unkind
to him, although all the while she was longing to
throw herself on his bosom and draw his arms
close about her!”</p>

<p>“What!” I said incredulously. “She did that?
Was she mad, then?”</p>

<p>“No; she was a woman, and she played with
him because that is woman’s nature.”</p>

<p>“Yet she knew he loved her!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, her eyes glowing more
and more. “She knew he loved her, deeply and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
purely, as she could never hope to be loved again;
but she resolved to put him to one supreme test.
If he stood the test she would adore him, worship
him, she would be his, body and soul, through all
eternity. If he did not stand it—well, she would
still love him!”</p>

<p>“And did he stand it?” I asked, moved more
and more by this story, to which at first I had
listened but indifferently.</p>

<p>“Let me finish, and you will see. She returned
to her home, she opened her heart to her father,
who is really the kindest and noblest of men, and
he agreed to assist her in the test. So to-day—this
evening——”</p>

<p>She faltered, stopped and looked at me, smiling
tremulously, her cheeks flooded suddenly with
color.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I cried; “this evening——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is more difficult than I had thought!
How shall I go on? Three months ago, monsieur,
there was a death in our family.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” I asked, failing to see what this had to
do with the story.</p>

<p>“It was that of my father’s elder brother,” she
continued unsteadily, without looking at me, “so
that my father, who up to that time had been M. de
Benseval, succeeded to the title and became—became——”</p>

<p>“M. de Chambray!” I shouted, seeing it all as
in a lightning flash; and I sprang toward her,
blind with sudden joy.</p>

<p>For an instant she tried to hold me off; but my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
arms were about her, straining her to me. Then
suddenly she yielded, and nestled to me, close—close
against my heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, my love!—my love!—my love!” she
cried, and raised her lips to mine.</p>

<p>“Did you call, M. de Tavernay?” asked a
voice; and I raised my head to see my father’s
friend standing upon the threshold, looking at us
with smiling face.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur,” I answered as intelligibly as
I could. “I desired to announce to you that your
daughter has decided to marry me.”</p>

<p>“In faith,” he said, a humorous light in his
eye, “I somehow suspected it the moment I opened
the door.”</p>

<p>With which remark he closed it again, and left
us alone together.</p>

half a dozen of his rogues, in a street of
Paris at the time of the regency, when the Duc de Richelieu was at
the height of his career as a heart-breaker and the especial lover of
Louise de Valois.”—<i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p>

<p>“It deserves a place among the best of the recent historic novels,
and will live no doubt long after the present vogue has become a thing
of the past. It is a pleasure to read a romance of the past that is
not filled with blood-curdling deeds after the style of the ‘shilling
shocker,’ for Mr. Stevenson has written a story that appeals to the
best side of one’s nature. He has characterized noble men and gentle
women, who played fair always and were always true to themselves
and the best of human impulses. The ‘Old Regime,’ as he pictures
it, was a charming era when men bartered life freely, but held honor
and plighted word dearer than existence. Altogether the story is
good as to tone, artistic development of the plot, and finished style.”—<i>St.
Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-cap">HERE is a tale indeed—big and forceful, palpitating with
interest, and written with the sureness of touch and the
breadth of a man who is master of his art. Mr. Comfort
has drawn upon two practically new story-places in the world of
fiction to furnish the scenes for his narrative—India and Manchuria
at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. While the novel is distinguished
by its clear and vigorous war scenes, the fine and sweet
romance of the love of the hero, Routledge—a brave, strange,
and talented American—for the “most beautiful woman in London”
rivals these in interest.</p>

<p>The story opens in London, sweeps up and down Asia, and
reaches its most rousing pitch on the ghastly field of Liaoyang, in
Manchuria. The one-hundred-mile race from the field to a free
cable outside the war zone, between Routledge and an English
war correspondent, is as exciting and enthralling as anything that
has appeared in fiction in recent years.</p>

<p>“A big, vital, forceful story that towers giant-high—a romance to lure the
hours away in tense interest—a book with a message for all mankind.”—<i>Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p>“Three such magnificent figures as Routledge, Noreen, and Rawder never
before have appeared together in fiction. Take it all in all, ‘Routledge Rides
Alone’ is a great novel, full of sublime conception, one of the few novels that
are as ladders from heaven to earth.”—<i>San Francisco Argonaut.</i></p>

<p>“The story unfolds a vast and vivid panorama of life. The first chapters
remind one strongly of the descriptive Kipling we once knew. We commend the
book for it’s sustained interest. We recommend it for its descriptive power.”—<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>

<p>“Here is one of the strongest novels of the year; a happy blending of
romance and realism, vivid, imaginative, dramatic, and, above all, a well told story
with a purpose. It is a red-blooded story of war and love, with a touch of the
mysticism of India, some world politics, love of country, and hate of oppression—a
tale of clean and expert workmanship, powerful and personal.”—<i>Pittsburg Dispatch.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">A remarkable novel, full of vital force, which gives us
a glimpse into the innermost sanctuary of a woman’s
soul—a revelation of the truth that to a woman there may
be a greater thing than the love of a man—the story pictured
against a wonderful Southern California background.</p>

<p>“One of the big headliners in bookland.”—<i>Detroit News.</i></p>

<p>“The book is a tissue of mysteries, quite apart from the ordinary
usages, but solved in the end satisfactorily.”—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“One of those rare examples of literary composition the artistic
excellence of which is uniform and even throughout.”—<i>Charleston News and Courier.</i></p>

<p>“There is color, vitality, and freshness in the picture, and
charming variety of detail in the development of story. Horton
is the ideal lover, strong-hearted, wilful, persevering; and Kate
is the vivid, tantalizing, impersonal creature in an armor of secrecy.
But the author transforms this woman into a being of rarest and
most beautiful human qualities—or rather, brings those latent emotions
to the fore. She is a woman racked by grief over death and
unhappy marital experiences in youth, and, later, a woman ‘lied
to, tortured, duped, and her heart polluted and desecrated’; and
in giving up her beloved lawyer-friend, whom she would have
married, to the ‘helpless, motherless, hampered’ child who so
passionately claimed his love, Kate’s humanism stands out in almost
supernatural power.”—<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>

<p>What do you know of the Sargasso Sea—that

two men and a charming young woman, got drawn

of vessels, that had been similarly caught by the
revolving current, and had been there, some of them,
since the days of the Spaniards. It is all so vivid

the marvellous lost galleons of Spain. The experiences

<p>“<i>The Woman in Question</i>” is a romance, but not of
Valeria nor mediæval England. Mr. Scott has remained
home in America, and the scenes are laid in the Eastern
United States. The story is distinctly modern in tone and
theme, and centers in and around Fairlawn Hall, an old
mansion with a marvellous garden, lying on the outskirts of
Egerton, where the new master has come with a party of
friends—to find mystery, misfortune, and love awaiting him.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott shows steady improvement in each succeeding
novel, and he has planned this latest story well, filling it
with many surprises and dramatic moments.</p>

<p>“The story has dash and verve.”—<i>New York Times Saturday Review of Books.</i></p>

<p>“There are few heroines in latter-day American fiction comparable
with charming Mildred Gascoyne.”—<i>Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>“The dialogue is bright and sparkling, the characters interesting, and
the plot sufficiently exciting. The woman in question, young, beautiful,
and spirited, is involved in mystery, the unfolding of which introduces
some thrilling episodes.”—<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
